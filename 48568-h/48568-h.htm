<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>Two problems in the script have engaged the serious
attention of critics. The first and simpler of the two
is that which is involved in the language and literary
form of the messages. This is a curious patchwork of
Low Latin, Middle English of mixed periods, and
Modern English of varied style and diction. It is a
mosaic of multi-coloured fragments cemented together
in a strangely random fashion. This anomaly is the
more remarkable from the contrast it presents to the
sustained and consistent burden of the script itself,
which, as though in obedience to some preordained
intention and settled plan, seems to proceed to the
presentment, line by line, of a completed whole, with
absolute patience and indifference to interruptions.
Lapse of time seems of no account. After a break of
several hours, the thread is resumed at the point
where it had been dropped. The unfinished communications
about the Loretto Chapel in 1911 are picked
up and spontaneously completed five years later.
Nevertheless, the queer patchwork of language is again
evident.</p>

<p>For this fact, the following explanation is offered.
It will easily be conceded that whatever the source or
inspiring influence of these messages, the language in
which they are conveyed is the <em>mechanical side</em> of the
matter, the most assuredly conventional element in the
process of transmission. But the obvious instruments
are the brains of F.B.B. and J.A. The reasoning and
reflective faculties are at the time in abeyance or are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
otherwise engaged,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> their attention being entirely
diverted: but the storehouse of memories and subconscious
impressions latent within are being used,
and quite independently used, though concurrently in
point of time with the normal use of the thinking
faculties on a wholly different subject.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment the human brain as the
repository of all impressions made on the mind from
childhood upwards. Thus viewed, it becomes, as it
were, an encyclopedia of all knowledge which the conscious
mind has stored, each item recording an idea of
a certain quality, in such language as circumstances
may at the time have dictated. Suppose then&mdash;and it
is not difficult to do so&mdash;that each of these records is
responsive to the impulse of an Idea which is seeking
expression, and whose instrument of expression is
some sort of sympathetic vibration attuned to the
original thought which recorded the particular memory
or subject. The sympathetic vibration lays hold of
the denser or physical particles of the record, causing
them to respond and to emit their own proper voice.</p>

<p>In other words, the language of the script would be
simply the product of the reaction of our brain-records
to the sympathetic vibration of Idea, from whatever
source arising.</p>

<p>Not that such conditions are always necessary or
possible. There are, for example, many quite well-authenticated
cases of automatic writing in which not
only the idea conveyed is outside the consciousness of
the writer, but the language itself is entirely unknown
to him, or to her, as the case may be. Take, for
example, the many recorded cases of automatic writing
in languages unknown to the medium, and sometimes
requiring special scholarship to appreciate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
The explanation seems in this case to be that the
mind of the medium is plastic to a more direct
spiritual influence which can therefore mould its
particles and create a new record for itself. This must
have been so in the Gift of Tongues at the Pentecost,
and later in the history of the Primitive Church.</p>

<p>The second problem noted by critics is a more
difficult one. It concerns the intelligent source of the
messages. As to this, I have propounded the view of
a Greater Memory transcending, and interpenetrating
our own. This theory is suggestive rather than explanatory.
It does not, and cannot, explain many
things which in our present state of knowledge are inexplicable.
Neither does it pretend to cover the whole
ground. It is, as I say, merely suggestive. Its virtue
is that it excludes no other possible agencies, hence
leaving room not only for the exercise of transcendental
faculty, such as clairvoyance, but for any variety of
<em>primary</em> impulse, and for any number or degree of
directive agencies capable of employing it.</p>

<p>For as we are obliged by our own experience to
acknowledge that our own latent memory is revived
and brought out in these scripts by some intelligence
working apart from our conscious minds; and to admit
that telepathy between two is involved: so we are
also bound to allow the possible presence of a further
range of telepathic action working through our minds
in the production of these messages. And if we are
prepared to agree on the one hand that whereas the
physical brain dissolves at death and its action ceases,
yet, on the other hand, that a more inward and less
material brain, the organ and vehicle of the subconscious
or intuitive self, still persists and survives entirely the
death of the physical body, and if we consider this
more inward brain as composed of finer particles,
responsive to the far more rapid movements of intuitive
thought, then we shall have to allow that the memory-record
of any defunct personality, if capable of response
<em>to the same stimulus of spiritual Will and Idea which can</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span><em>
actuate our own</em>, can be drawn upon in like manner by
the energising Intelligence, and again, as in our own
case, <em>without evoking the conscious "spirit" or personality
proper to it</em>. This is surely the meaning of Johannes
when he says (p. 95):</p>

<p>"Why cling I to that which is not? It is I, and it is
not I, butt part of me which dwelleth in the past, and is
bound to that which my carnal soul loved and called
'home' these many years. Yet I, Johannes, amm of
many partes, and ye better part doeth other things&mdash;Laus,
laus Deo!&mdash;only that part which remembreth
clingeth like memory to what it seeth yet."</p>

<p>Thus it seems to me the problem of personality, in
the sense of the conscious personal presence of individuals
deceased, need not arise at all in connection
with these writings. All that it seems vital to assume
is the union of the deeper strata of our own latent
mind or dream-consciousness with others of a kindred
nature and tone, by virtue of their sympathetic and
accordant motion in the presence of a greater and all-inclusive
spiritual essence, Idea, or Will, omnipresent
and all-permeating, waking into activity all dormant
memory-records, and directing them into any channel
of mind which by previous preparation on the conscious
plane has become receptive and retentive of them.</p>

<p>Still small Voices from a distant Time!&mdash;thrilling
through the void and stirring faint resonances within
the deeps of our own being&mdash;the great Telepathy, the
true Communion of Mind, the gate of the Knowledge,
the Gnosis of the apostle, whose key is Mental Sympathy,
the key that the lawyers took away, neither
entering themselves, nor suffering others to enter.</p>

<p>No discord can mar this communion, since love and
understanding are its law. Death cannot touch it:
rather is he Keeper of the Gate. Time, as we know
it, here counts for naught, for to the deeper dream-consciousness,
a day may be as a thousand years, and
a period of trance or sleeping as one tick of the clock.</p>

<h2 id="NOTE">NOTE</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By SIR WILLIAM BARRETT, F.R.S.</span></p>


<p>As some readers of this remarkable book have thought
it too incredible to be a record of fact, but rather deemed
it a work of imagination, it may be useful to add my
testimony to that given in the book as to the genuineness
of the whole narrative.</p>

<p>The author has, I am sure, with scrupulous fidelity
and care, presented an accurate record of the scripts
obtained through the automatic writing of his friend,
together with all the archæological knowledge of the ruins
of Glastonbury Abbey that was accessible before the
excavations were begun. In order to remove any doubt
on this point, before further excavations were made, Mr.
Bligh Bond has wisely asked representatives of certain
societies to examine the later scripts which refer to the
Loretto Chapel, note their contents, and see how far the
further excavations may or may not verify any of the
statements made in the later scripts.</p>

<p>From any point of view the present book is of great
interest. To the student of psychology, who ignores
any supernormal acquisition of knowledge and yet
accepts the good faith of the author, the problem presents
many difficulties. Chance coincidence may be suggested,
but this does not carry us far. The question therefore
arises, where did the veridical or truth-telling information
given in some of these scripts come from? As is
so often the case in automatic writing a dramatic form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
is taken, and messages purport to come from different
deceased people. The subconscious or subliminal self
of the automatist, doubtless, is the source of much contained
in the scripts, and may possibly be responsible
for all the insight shown. But in that case we must
confer upon the subconsciousness of the automatist
faculties hitherto unrecognised by official science. The
author has pointed out, on p. 156, some of the powers
the subconscious mind must be assumed to possess; to
these we may add a possible telepathic transfer of information
between the author and the automatist, and
also occasionally the faculty of <em>clairvoyance</em>, or a transcendental
perceptive power; for, according to the investigations
of the author, some of the statements made
in the script were unknown to any living person, and not
found in historical records, prior to their verification in
subsequent excavation. We must, however, be on our
guard against the too facile use of words such as "telepathy"
and "subliminal consciousness" as a cloak to
our ignorance. The history of physical science shows
how progress has often been retarded by the use of
phrases to account for obscure phenomena&mdash;words such
as "Phlogiston," "Catalysis," etc., which explained
nothing, and now are ridiculed, but which were once
used by scientific authorities as unquestionable axioms.
It is wiser to acknowledge our ignorance and convey
our thanks to the author and his friend for the patient
and laborious care with which they have furnished valuable
material for future psychological explanation. Nor
must we omit to recognise the courage shown by Mr.
Bligh Bond in the publication of a work which might
possibly jeopardise the high reputation he enjoys.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span></p>

<p>Since the last issue of this work, the foundations of the Chapel
of the Loretto at Glastonbury have been partly excavated, and
are found to accord, so far, with the statements received in

<p class="center"><big>THE GATE OF REMEMBRANCE</big></p>


<h3><a name="THE_LOST_CHAPEL" id="THE_LOST_CHAPEL">THE LOST CHAPEL</a></h3>


<p>The green isle of Glaston, severed as it was from
the outer world by its girdle of marsh and mere,
was from old time a haunt of peace. Its history
as a religious foundation goes back into the mists
of antiquity, and is lost in legend and fable. To
this quiet retreat, this secluded stronghold of a
more ancient faith, the footsteps of the first
Christian missioners were guided, and the company
of Eastern pilgrims found rest in its green
recesses and a well-guarded focus for the great
work of evangelising the isle of Britain.</p>

<p>Successive waves of pagan immigration flooded
the land, yet never was the lamp of truth extinguished
here; and, stranger still, those who
came, though of alien race and custom, cherished
the older landmarks and sought not to destroy;
for the heritage of Glaston was not the heritage
of any individual race, but of all&mdash;a trust for
Christendom.</p>

<p>Within the sacred precincts the dust of many
holy men was preserved, and the church enshrined
their relics. She grew great through the pious
benefactions of kings and nobles whose memory
she kept green. Among these the gifts of the
great Saxon King, Edgar, "yclept The Peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>able,"<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
were always gratefully remembered. In
the great Abbey Church there was a chapel to his
honour, well endowed, and, we doubt not, sumptuously
furnished. But it was not esteemed sufficient,
and in the day of Richard Bere, the last
great building Abbot, it was decided that a new
and more glorious monument should be erected
to his memory. So we learn from Leland, who
saw the chapel as it stood, a completed work, but
a few years before the dissolution and ruin of the
monastery.
Then came, in 1539, the forced surrender, the
barbarous execution of the last Abbot, Whiting,
the violation of the shrines, and the dispersal of all
the treasures of art and learning stored within the
Abbey walls. But of the Edgar Chapel nothing
more is heard, save that we can infer from a document
we quote that it was standing in the days of
Elizabeth. Yet it is doubtful whether it can have
lasted through half her reign. And perhaps it
was one of the first of the buildings to be utterly
destroyed, since even its memory had perished
and its form and grandeur were alike forgotten.
Those who have seen the delicate and beautiful
work at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, or
that masterpiece of stonecraft, the Chapel of King
Henry VII. at Westminster, may form some idea
of the general character of this Chapel of Edgar
in its finished state.</p>

<p>Local memory and tradition generally preserve
some traces, however dim or distorted, of an archi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>tectural
work of great magnitude and beauty,
but it is a strange fact that this one had utterly
faded out of knowledge save for some scattered
and obscure notes in the pages of the old county
antiquaries, which contained no hint of its identity.</p>

are approximately harmonised by Leland's record of the lengthening
of the choir by Abbot Monington to the extent of two
bays, and the throwing out of his new retro-choir to the east,
which would absorb about two-thirds of the length of this chapel.</p>

<h3><a name="DISCOVERY_OF_THE_EDGAR_CHAPEL" id="DISCOVERY_OF_THE_EDGAR_CHAPEL">DISCOVERY OF THE EDGAR CHAPEL,
GLASTONBURY ABBEY:</a></h3>

<p class="center">AN ACCOUNT OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT</p>

<p>The following is the story of the discovery which,
in 1908, caused a good deal of public interest, and
provided the archæological world with an object
of attention.</p>

<p>Although known to a small circle of friends of the
writer and his colleague in the research, and to
the Secretary of the Society for Psychical Research,
who was intimately acquainted with both, and in
touch with them at the time, no publication of
the circumstances has yet been made, and this
was withheld largely for reasons more or less
personal to the writer, though the intention had
always been to make known the facts whenever
the time should seem ripe for the disclosure.</p>

<p>The entire record has been preserved, and the
testimony of both the writer and his friend being
available, as well as the contemporary evidence of
the Secretary of the S.P.R., it will be seen that the
matter stands on a fairly good basis in respect
of documentary witness.</p>

<p>For reasons of convenience, initials will be used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
in the ensuing account. F.B.B. will denote the
writer, and J.A. his friend, John Alleyne.</p>

<p>In anticipation of an appointment to the
position of Director of Excavations at Glastonbury
Abbey on behalf of the Somerset Archæological
Society, of which he was a member, F.B.B.
had, during 1907, devoted considerable time to
the study of the ruins and their history, and to that
of the older religious foundations, and in this
J.A. assisted him. Most of the surviving accounts
of the Abbey were gone through, both the works
of the mediæval writers and those of the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, with
the fragments collected by them from older
sources. Among the first, the works of William
of Malmesbury, Adam de Domerham, William
Wyrcestre, and John of Glaston, were examined,
whilst Leland was not overlooked, and the
later antiquaries, Hearne, Dugdale, Hollar, and
Stukeley, had their share of attention. Following
these, Browne-Willis, Britton, Carter, Collinson,
Phelps, Kerrich, and Warner, were consulted,
and finally some careful attention was bestowed
on the modern antiquaries, Parker, Freeman, and
last, but not least in importance, Professor Willis,
whose <cite>Architectural History</cite> was the standard
book of reference on the subject during the latter
half of the nineteenth century, and still remains
of the greatest usefulness to students.</p>

<p>Glastonbury Abbey having passed out of
private hands into the custody of a body of
Trustees, acting on behalf of the National Church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
it was hoped that a greatly increased opportunity
for research and excavation would ensue. All
published plans of the Great Church had been
necessarily very incomplete, in the absence of
visible remains and the lack of trustworthy evidence
from documents. In particular the following
features were in doubt:</p>

<p>1. The form of the retro-quire, and eastward
termination of the Abbey Church.</p>

<p>2. The question of a north porch to the nave,
and its probable position, if it existed.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retro-quire and Chapels.</span></p>

<p>In 1866 Professor R. Willis published his invaluable
<cite>Architectural History</cite>, being the substance
of a communication he had made to the
Archæological Institute in the year previous.
He devotes two pages (40, 41) to a discussion of the
number and arrangement of the chapels east of
the processional path in the retro-quire, and
arrives at the conclusion that they were five in
number. And in his plan (Fig. 2), which appears
as a frontispiece to his work, he shows these five,
the central one projecting about 12 feet. On p. 43
he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As Bere is also said to have built Edgar's Chapel at
the east end of the church, it is probable that this chapel
was one of those that we are considering, and that Bere
fitted it up and completed it. The complete eradication of
the east wall of the church in the centre may be accounted
for by supposing that the central chapel projected eastward,
as I have shown in the plan, and that this chapel
was Edgar's; for if it had been only one of the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
chapels it would not have been worth mentioning as a
distinct building."<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/fig_02.jpg" width="283" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_2"></a>Fig. 2.&mdash;Professor Willis's Plan.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Professor Willis's conjecture represents the
largest or most liberal interpretation yet placed
by any antiquary upon the passage from Leland&mdash;which,
it may be said, is the only known contemporary
evidence of this work of the last two
Abbots.</p>

<p>Parker,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> who reviewed the whole subject of the
plan in his work for the Somerset Archæological
Society (see his article in their <cite>Proceedings</cite> for
1880), does not support Willis's conclusions, inclining
rather to the view that the Edgar Chapel was
in the south transept, to the east of the <em>nave</em>, but
it is within the writer's knowledge that Professor
Freeman believed that the original quire, which,
before Monington's addition of a fifth and sixth
bay, must have been shorter by some 39 feet,
was furnished with a large eastern chapel, prob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>ably
a Lady-chapel, and that this may have been
of quite considerable dimensions and even co-extensive
in total length with the plan as given by
Willis. But this view does not appear to have
gone farther than a mere expression of opinion
verbally given at a meeting in the Abbey, and the
writer only heard it quoted as a reminiscence some
time after the discovery of the Edgar Chapel.</p>

<p>It appears to have been put forward as an explanation
of the curious diagram given in Phelps's
<cite>Somerset</cite>, where a plan of the church is published,
showing in dotted lines a short projection at the
point where Willis shows his chapel, and this is
given a semicircular or apsidal end.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Phelps calls
this the "Lady's Chapel." And in the corner of
the same sheet this author gives another long
rectangular diagram, again with a semicircular end,
which Warner, who reproduces the plan, calls
the "Chapel according to its original dimensions."
The apse being the constant feature,
these additional dimensions would be to the west,
and would answer to the difference in the former
and the latter dimensions of the quire which
Monington lengthened in 1344-5. And it will be
clear that some such reasoning may have guided
Parker or Freeman to the tentative conclusion
mentioned, and have assisted Willis to form his
definite theory of a slight prominence in the central
chapel of the later retro-quire.</p>

<p>Among the documents which have been recovered
whose period is that of the immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
post-Reformation, is one which would have been
readily accessible to Willis and others, and which
is preserved by Phelps and copied by Warner in
his <cite>Glastonbury</cite>, published in the twenties of the
last century. This is a transcript of a report
made to Queen Elizabeth by a Commissioner,
who was sent to make an inventory of the Abbey
buildings, and he gives a series of measurements
of the principal parts of the monastery, including
the Abbey Church, as to which he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The great church in the Aby was in length 594 as
followeth:</p>

<p>
The Chapter House, in length, 90 foot.<br />
The Quier, in length, 159 foot; in breadth, 75 foot.<br />
The bodie of the Church, in length, 228 foot.<br />
The Joseph's chapell, in length, 117 foot."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the seventeenth century we have the bare
statements of Hollar and of Hearne, that the total
length of the Abbey Church was 580 feet.</p>

<p>All the measures given by the Elizabethan
Commissioner are very excessive, and perhaps for
that reason, as well as for the confusion of idea
suggested by the association of the Chapter-House
measure with those of the Church, they
have been rejected, or not regarded, by modern
antiquaries. In like manner the bare statement
of Hollar and Hearne, being without any description
of what buildings were to be included in
their measure, has not been taken into account.</p>

<p>Professor Willis's review of the probabilities of
the plan of the east end seemed conclusive as
regards the existence of five chapels in a row on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
the east wall of the retro-quire, for the construction
he places upon William Wyrcestre's description
must be admitted to be most reasonable,
fortified as it is by the record of Wild's plan (1813),
in which the bases of two piers with fragments of
wall attached and running eastward are shown in
precisely the position required as partitions for
the forming of the three central chapels of the five.</p>

<p>These piers had evidently been recently discovered,
and are figured in Britton's <cite>Architectural
Antiquaries</cite>, vol. iv., p. 195. But all trace of
them has been cleared away, and, as Willis himself
says (<cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 42):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unfortunately, the practice in respect to these ruins
until the beginning of this century and later was always
to remove not merely the wrought stones, but also to
eradicate the foundations. And although the remains
have been for many years protected from this kind of
destruction, <span class="smcap">THERE IS NO HOPE LEFT OF RECOVERING
ANY DETAILS OF PLAN BY EXCAVATIONS</span>." (<i>Capitals
mine.&mdash;F.B.B.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>So the matter remained until, in 1903-4, the
Archæological Institute decided to make Glastonbury
the scene of its labours, and Mr. (now Sir
William) St. John Hope was deputed to prepare
a paper for their annual meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Hope, having in mind such plans as Abbey
Dore, where four chapels appear against the east
wall of the retro-quire, reviews William Wyrcestre's
statement in this light, and places on his words an
alternative construction such as would be correct
if that writer had been habitually precise in his
descriptions. But he is not precise, and a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
inspection of his writings will sufficiently show
that he has a peculiar method of representing
facts where number, series, locality, or dimension
are involved. In the present instance he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"IN ORIENTALI PARTE ALTARIS GLASTONIE.</p>

<p>"Spacium de le reredes ex parte orientali magne altaris
sunt 5 columpnæ seriatim et inter quamlibet columpnam
est capella cum altare."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Hope thought that Wyrcestre counted each
respond as a whole column, which would mean
three whole columns and two responds or piers
engaged with the walls north and south, suggesting,
of course, four chapels only. He caused
trenches to be cut east and west along the site
of his supposed central dividing wall, and one
north and south immediately outside the east wall
of the retro-quire and across the gap where the
central chapel of Willis ought to have been. But
nothing turned up which to his mind was indicative
of an extension of building beyond the line
of the two remaining fragments of walling marking
the eastward end of the retro-quire, and his
conclusion is definite&mdash;that there was not, and
could never have been, any such extension of a
central chapel. And he claimed to have found
support for his view of a mid-partition giving a
total of four, and not five, chapels, through the
confirmatory results of his excavation. Such was
the position in 1907 when the writer commenced
his studies, and it will readily be seen that no
prospect of success could reasonably be expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
to attend further research by excavation beyond
this point.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/fig_03.jpg">
<img src="images/fig_03s.jpg" width="400" height="481" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_3"></a>Fig. 3.</span></div>
</div>

<p>All the evidence was sifted and discussed by
F.B.B. and J.A. F.B.B. attached perhaps as
little weight to the conflicting records of a longer
measure as had those who went before him. But
he distinctly preferred Willis's solution to others,
as there was no gainsaying the significance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Wild's plan with its two intermediate column-bases.
And instinctively he felt, as his friend also
felt, that the question was not solved, the last
word not said. More than once, the feeling returned
that a chapel which was thought worthy
of special mention by Leland, and which, according
to his account, was the work of two Abbots, must
have been a work of some importance.</p>

<p>Still, nothing came uppermost in the mind
which would tend to modify the writer's respect
for Willis's view, nor, indeed, to challenge its probability.
It was rather with the object of defending
this view, as against the contradictory one
more recently put forward, that the intention was
formed to examine, as soon as circumstances
might permit, the site of Wild's twin piers, and to
dig deep around the spot in the hope of finding yet
some trace of footings characteristic of a crypt; for
Wild noted these as being "probably part of the
crypt," and it did not appear that anyone had
taken the trouble to investigate this matter.</p>

<p>Wild's plan, incorporated in Britton's "Antiquities,"
may be regarded as a standard work.
In this respect it claims greater weight than others
such as Phelps's or Stukeley's, which are vague
and inaccurate. Warner copies Phelps, and claims
a fourteenth-century Lady-Chapel at the east,
but neither Britton nor Stukeley, whose plan is
two hundred years old, supports his view.
Warner's note is quoted by Professor Willis
(ref. to p. 31 of his <cite>Architectural History</cite>).</p>

<h3><a name="PRINCIPLES_AND_METHODS_OF_PSYCHOLOGY" id="PRINCIPLES_AND_METHODS_OF_PSYCHOLOGY">PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF PSYCHOLOGY
APPLIED TO ARCHÆOLOGICAL
RESEARCH</a></h3>


<p>It has been said that the great distinction between
East and West in the matter of learning has been
that whilst Western science deals with phenomena
and builds upon deductions from observation of
external things, Eastern wisdom looks always
inwardly, seeking to find the answer to all enigmas
of creation in the mind of man. The one develops
the logical faculty, often, perhaps, at the sacrifice
of the imaginative functions; whilst the other
follows the intuitive powers, not regarding logical
rules. But, as a matter of fact, neither method
can be employed to the exclusion of the other,
and any great discovery of Western science will
be found the outcome of interaction between the
two principles. It had always been clear, however,
to the writer that the part played by the
intuitive or, as Myers would say, subliminal
powers of the mind is habitually set aside by the
orthodox naturalist, who is apt to see little beyond
his specimens and what can logically be inferred
from them. And archæological research has been
in such a manner hidebound, and, it must be admitted,
with some reason; for, as a comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
young science, it has had to protect itself against
many a foolish fantasy launched by a half-instructed
or over-enthusiastic devotee. To describe
these as "vain imaginations" would be
correct, as the word "vain" is a sufficient qualification,
but the writer at all times deprecates the
use of the noble word "imagination" in the debased
sense of a mere fantasy. Imagination is a
great gift, a Divine power of the mind, and may be
trained and educated to receive and to create only
that which is true. And this, maybe, is the secret
of much of the spiritual understanding and wisdom
of the East.</p>

<p>But we Western folks think it unpractical to
cultivate this gift. We have no system for training
it, and our bourgeois habit of mind despises it.
In our slipshod way, we say of anything not
founded on fact, "It is all imagination," and
similarly we are wont to misuse the term "illusion"
by employing it to characterise positive
delusion.</p>

<p>The training of the imaginative faculty upon
scientific lines and its application to archæological
research had long been a favourite notion
of the writer's, and he and J.A. had many a talk
on the subject; but the difficulty was as to the
method most likely to secure the results at which
they aimed.</p>

<p>What was clear enough, however, was the need
of somehow switching off the mere logical
machinery of the brain which is for ever at work
combining the more superficial and obvious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
things written on the pages of memory, and
by its dominant activity excluding that which a
more contemplative element in the mind would
seek to revive from the half-obliterated traces
below.</p>

<p>And it occurred to F.B.B. that in the faculty
of automatism which his friend was believed to
possess, but which he had never used deliberately
(it had operated once or twice in his life spontaneously),
there might be found the key to success
in this direction. F.B.B. was a member of the
Society for Psychical Research. Both he and J.A.
were intimate with Mr. Everard Feilding, Secretary
of the Society, who had been greatly interested in
J.A.'s account of certain phenomena of automatism
which he had experienced. And E.F. had been
present at one or two experiments in the calling
of these powers into play.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the actual narrative of
the discovery in connection with Glastonbury, it
must be further premised that neither F.B.B. nor
J.A. favoured the ordinary spiritualistic hypothesis
which would see in these phenomena <em>the
action of discarnate intelligences from the outside
upon the physical or nervous organisation of the
sitters</em>. They would regard such a view as something
like a reversal or turning inside-out of the
truth. But that the embodied consciousness of
every individual is but a part, and a fragmentary
part, of a transcendent whole, and that within the
mind of each there is a door through which Reality
may enter as Idea&mdash;Idea presupposing a greater,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
even a cosmic Memory, conscious or unconscious,
active or latent, and embracing not only
all individual experience and revivifying forgotten
pages of life, but also Idea involving yet wider
fields, transcending the ordinary limits of time,
space, and personality&mdash;this would be a better
description of the mental attitude of the two
friends.</p>

<p>The following may be quoted as indicating
F.B.B's temper of mind and feeling at a time
closely following the date of the experiments he
made with J.A. It may be found as a passage in
the Illuminated Address which he prepared for,
and which was accepted by, the Queen on her visit
as Princess of Wales to the Abbey in 1909, and
was conceived as a part of the "lovynge Greetinge
of y<sup>e</sup> monkes of Glaston to theyre Prince and
Princesse. xxii Jun: A<sup>o</sup> Mcmix." This extract
runs as follows. It was not automatic, but was
doubtless influenced to some extent by a strong
feeling in more than one quarter that Glastonbury
would be renewed as a centre of spiritual realisation
and reconciliation between the various racial
elements in these islands and their distinctive
religious expressions, not yet co-ordinated (see the
writer's article on "Glastonbury" in the Christmas
number of the <cite>Treasury</cite> for 1908, also an
address by Canon Masterman given in London in
the same year). Glastonbury, as is well known,
was a centre of pilgrimage from all parts of the
world. In most ancient times it was compared
with Rome and Jerusalem:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For y<sup>e</sup> past dyeth not but slepeth, nay ffor perchaunce
hit wakyth and hit ys they of y<sup>e</sup> present who doe slepe
and dreme. Hit ys euen as a ffar countrie ffrom y<sup>e</sup> which
they heare tydynges: Yet men will fare vnto londes ffarr
distant and y<sup>e</sup> weelth hath bene theyr guerdon euen soe
wayteth euer ffor man y<sup>e</sup> treasure of y<sup>e</sup> wisdom of past
tymes and yeeldeth her vnto y<sup>e</sup> loue whych seekyth and
ys ne wearyed; soe schal y<sup>e</sup> memorie of oldetyme thinges
be reuealyd and of Glaston hit ys sayd y<sup>t</sup> when y<sup>e</sup> tymes

</div></div>

<p>These verses were evolved one day in automatic
writing. What their origin neither F.B.B. nor
J.A. know&mdash;neither can recall having read them.
Owing to their beauty and suggestiveness, they
were incorporated in the Address in a form slightly
modified from the original.</p>

<h3><a name="ON_AUTOMATISM" id="ON_AUTOMATISM">ON AUTOMATISM</a></h3>


<p>The essential objection to the methods and practices
of the spiritualists, and the ground of that
instinctive repugnance which is normally felt
towards these methods, is undoubtedly that they
imply a surrender of the will and powers of self-control
to activities which, for good or evil, are
outside the personal sphere of the medium. The
higher spiritual gifts are those in which the recipient
acts as a conscious participator in the act
of transmission. Between these two extremes is
a class intermediate in nature, which is apparently
recognised by St. Paul in the first Epistle
to the Corinthians,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> the typical instance quoted
being that of the "gift of tongues" whose exercise,
whilst not discouraged by him, was nevertheless
noted as of inferior value, since it did not
tend always to the edification of the Church. But
it was one phase of a form of inspiration then
known, probably as a common phenomenon, and
there can be little or no doubt that it was accompanied
by others of a similar sort, and that inspirational
writing was possibly one of the most
ordinary of these. The one necessarily follows
from the other. There is even a possible element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of the kind to be weighed in any satisfying theory
of Biblical inspiration, and the prophetic utterances
connected therewith, and it will have to be
considered fairly and apart from theological preconceptions.</p>

<p>It is clear from the chapter in Corinthians (1 Cor.
xiv.) that in the exercise of the gift of tongues
the speaker generally knew little or nothing of the
meaning of what he was saying, though it is not
necessary to assume that the utterance was beyond
his control. But it implies the action of
what, in modern language, has been spoken of as
a supraliminal part of the mind, when, to quote
the Apostle, "the understanding is unfruitful."</p>

<p>The exercise of automatism&mdash;a controlled automatism&mdash;in
the production of writing seems to
the author a reasonable parallel, and, where the
result is capable of ready interpretation, there,
according to the Apostolic dictum, is the hope
of "edification" by its means. And for those
prepared and ready for its exercise the gift of
prophecy in those days awaited manifestation
through them. And it is not necessary to suppose
that the gifts then bestowed were unique, in the
sense that they were afterwards to be withdrawn
for all time. On the contrary, it is quite clear
from Scripture itself that a great revival of them
was to be expected in later days, as Peter says in
Acts ii. 17, quoting the prophet Joel:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith
God, I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh: and
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your
young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
dreams.</em>"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>Are we not led to believe that there is no limitation
to the "liberal gifts" of the spirit nor to the
variety in the nature of the spiritual gifts which
may be exercised? They may be concerned with
any possible branch of mental activity, and all
new ideas, whether in art, science, philosophy,
politics, religion, or what not, must be held to be
included. Nor need the manner or method of
such inspiration concern us as of primary importance,
however unusual such may chance to appear.
The one test is the quality of its message, whether
it be truthful or otherwise, edifying or lacking in
helpful qualities. If a message of this nature be
found true, it cannot be dictated by a spirit of
falsehood; if sane, then not by insanity; if wholesome
and moral, then not by a vicious or depraved
intelligence. Men do not gather grapes of thorns,
or figs of thistles.</p>

<p>The germination of new and profitable ideas in
the mind may in this respect be brought about,
firstly, by a suitable system of mental exercise
and culture; secondly, by a willingness to hold back
all mental preferences and preconceptions, and to
restrain also the surface activities of the brain, so
that the channel of pure "idea" which resides in
the subconscious mind may be maintained, and
the finer activities allowed to percolate. Then
surely may be hoped for the reaction of those
energies sent forth by previous effort of the mind
and will, and ideas will flow back, not singly and
alone, but accompanied by a spiritual reinforcement
which may include elements new and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
great value, from sources beyond the ken of the
individual mind.</p>

<p>These new elements may be of all conceivable
kinds, moving instinct, intuition, imagination,
affection, or will. They may be vague and
abstract, or tinged, as in dreams, with a vivid
sense of personality; dispassionate or pulsing with
new enthusiasms; lighting the intelligence, or
moving in the dark region of the subliminal mind&mdash;in
this case perhaps incapable of being evoked
save by automatism or the telepathy of other
minds. From some inward and mysterious fount
they come, borne in upon us by dynamic impulse
carrying with it the fruition of memories and
experiences long dormant and inaccessible to us,
though within the range of the spiritual intelligence
which is the Directive power. Man is a
very complex being, and although, spiritually
speaking, he lives and acts in relation with his
fellow-men in, and by virtue of, his memories,
personal and ancestral&mdash;for what are character
and conscience but the fruition of all those
memories and experiences which are his own or
those of every pre-natal element in him?&mdash;yet,
may it not be that when released from physical
conditions, as at death, there will take place some
dissociation of the strata of his personality, the
mere brain-record, the husk, the mechanism of his
memories of common things, being scattered as
the chaff, or shaken off as a discarded coat,
whilst their fruit is garnered as new spiritual
power and knowledge in the soul's æonial treasury?</p>

<h3><a name="SOME_NOTES_ON_THE_SCRIPT_AND_ITS" id="SOME_NOTES_ON_THE_SCRIPT_AND_ITS">SOME NOTES ON THE SCRIPT AND ITS
PUBLICATION</a></h3>


<p>The decision to publish these writings was formed
after much careful weighing of all reasons for and
against, and their issue at the present juncture
was largely influenced by the feeling that public
interest in such matters had greatly ripened since
the war, and that the fruits of the author's experiment
should not be withheld, since they might
serve to direct that interest into a new and perhaps
profitable channel.</p>

<p>The script produced during the fairly long period
of time (from the end of 1907 to 1911, and again
in 1912 and more recently) was obtained under
varying conditions, and was of very varied
quality. A large proportion had reference to
Glastonbury and to monastic affairs and history,
and of this only a part would claim to possess any
sort of evidential value. Some was of private interest
only, and would be useless for publication.
Occasionally the attempted communication was a
failure. In a few cases there were noted some
very obvious misstatements. The most serious
of these was in the measures first given for the
Edgar Chapel, "Et Capella extensit 30 virgas ad
orientem et viginti virgas in latitudine(m)."<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
A "virga" is a yard. The script was very obscure,
and the measure was asked for again, with the
result that "quinquaginta virgas" was written.
A third time the confirmation was sought, and
this time the "30 virgas" was repeated. "Quinquaginta"
(50) was obviously a mistake, but the
repetition of the 30 virgas, though indicating a
length vastly in excess of anything we had ever
thought possible for this chapel, made one less
inclined to dismiss it without further attention.
The "viginti virgas" given once for the width
seemed quite out of the question. And as the
event proved, no measure approaching 20 yards
for the extreme width of the chapel could then
be shown to have existed. It appeared absurd,
and was then and there ruled out, together with
the inconsistent and excessive "quinquaginta
virgas" of length.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> This occurred at the close
of the first sitting, which had been a long one.
The writing was becoming less clear; the power
was failing, and the sitters beginning to feel
weary.</p>

<p>No further attempt was therefore made at the
time to elucidate the measures, but it was resolved
to try again on a subsequent occasion.
There was a very cold spell in the early winter of
1907-8, and the attempts during this period were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
mostly failures. On the 13th December the sitting
was abandoned for this reason. Another on the
21st produced nothing satisfactory. Again, on
the 3rd January, 1908, when the cold was at its
height, only a few cramped and uncertain words
could be obtained, in which these were traced:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Frigidus sum ... memoria oportet nullum ...
nescio quid aut quo<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> fecimus scriptum...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another and much more important cause of
failure must now be noted. About the beginning
of 1908 certain circumstances of a rather anxious
and trying nature were affecting one of the sitters.
This produced a preoccupation of mind unfavourable
to the production of automatic writing; and
it seems a well-established rule that the sitters'
minds must be placid and their mood quiescent
to obtain the best results. On the 30th January,
1908, a further attempt was made to obtain writing,
but with entire lack of success from this
cause, and all that was worth recording was a few
words, ending with the following: "Eschew self.
Something clogs the tones. Search yourselves
straitly."</p>

<p>It was not until the 19th of February that any
further really satisfactory results were attained,
and at this sitting the unspoken desire of the
sitters was met and a detailed description of the
Edgar Chapel given, including its outside measure
of width&mdash;namely, 34 feet. But it was not until
Sitting XXXII. on the 16th June that the final<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
confirmation came. This was in answer to a
question, and it was given as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The width ye shall find is twenty and seven, and outside,
thirty and four, so we remember.&mdash;BEERE ABBAS."</p></blockquote>

<p>At the date of this sitting, the west wall of the
chapel had been located, but its length not yet
ascertained, so that there was nothing to guide
opinion as to this save what could be inferred
from the position of the small section opened,
which showed it to be probably about 20 feet in
the clear of the footings, if placed centrally with
the quire. Then, in response to the further
question, What was the clear internal length of
the chapel? came the reply,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wee laid downe seventy and two, but they builded
longer."</p></blockquote>

<p>And the veridical nature of these figures was
shown by later knowledge. (See Table, p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a>.)</p>

<p>But to return to the subject of errors. At
Sitting XXXVI., on the 19th September, 1908,
there was given the story of a Saxon Earl, one
Eawulf, or Eanwulf, who was slain by a certain
Radulphus, Norman knight of the time of Turstin,
first Norman Abbot. The story is quite a good
one and contains what appears to be veridical
matter, but it is marred by a peculiarity. Halfway
through the script a strange mistake is noted.
The name of Turstin is substituted for Radulphus,
and the script says, "Eawulf and <em>Turstinus</em> did
fight, and the Norman did slay the Saxon." Now
such an error is tiresome, as it spoils the clearness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
of the story. Yet, in another way, it is interesting,
for the light that it throws on the mechanical
action of the brain as the probable source of error
in automatic writing or speaking.</p>

<p>It is a fact well known to those who are called
upon to speak in public, or who are engaged in
literary work, that unless the attention be fixed
and concentrated on the subject in hand, the brain
will act mechanically, causing repetition of any
word recently impressed on the mental tympanum,
and such word may easily be substituted for
another. Where there is fatigue, this may happen
very easily. In the case of automatic writing,
the mind is relaxed, and there is probably a predisposition
to such errors. The example given
seems a proof of it. It seems, indeed, a matter
for surprise that such mistakes are not more
numerous in the script obtained by us. On the
contrary, another phenomenon has been frequently
observed in connection with it. This is,
that at the commencement of a sitting the thread
of a former communication, broken by the termination
of a previous séance, would be resumed
almost as though no interval of time had elapsed.</p>

<p>It had been intended in the present work that
only the veridical matter concerning the Edgar
Chapel should appear in print; but the scope was
enlarged by the inclusion of Johannes, whose
personality seemed attractive. Later, it was decided
to allow the remarkable reminiscence of the
"Loretto" Chapel also to see the light of day, in
anticipation of further knowledge. But readers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
will understand that nothing like a wholesale
reproduction of the script in the author's possession
would be possible. At the same time it may be
clearly stated that in what is reserved there is
nothing which contradicts or negatives the value
of what is given, and of this the fact that the
author has been able with success to follow out
the indications given may be held sufficient
warrant.</p>

<p>No apology seems needed for the quality of the
"Latin" in the script, which is very much what
one might imagine to be the colloquial jargon of
illiterate members of the community, whose
knowledge of the tongue would be chiefly confined
to the service-books, or what they understood of
them.</p>

<p>The author would here record his indebtedness
to his friend J.A., not only for that cordial interest
and co-operation without which the new line of
research could not have been undertaken, nor
this work have seen the light of day; but also
for the verses he has written on the subject of
Plate III., and on the final Envoi. His thanks are
also due to Miss A. M. Buckton for her sonnet
(Plate I.) and for many valued suggestions; to
Mr. T. H. Felton for his permission to use material
from the Cannon MS.; to the Council of the
Somerset Archæological Society for loan of several
blocks (including Plate II.); and to Mr. Edward
Everard for the loan of Coney's and Stukeley's
plates; also to Mr. Everard Feilding for his constant
interest in the work and many helpful suggestions.</p>

<h3><a name="NARRATIVE_OF_THE_WRITINGS" id="NARRATIVE_OF_THE_WRITINGS">NARRATIVE OF THE WRITINGS</a></h3>


<p>It was on the 7th of November that F.B.B. and
J.A. had their first sitting for the purpose of
furthering the Glastonbury research. This took
place at 4.30 p.m. in F.B.B.'s office. J.A. held a
pencil, F.B.B. provided foolscap paper, which he
steadied with his left hand, whilst placing his
right lightly on the back of J.A.'s, so that his
fingers lay evenly across its surface.</p>

<p>F.B.B. started by asking the question, as though
addressed to some other person:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Can you tell us anything about Glastonbury?</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>J.A.'s fingers began to move, and one or two
lines of small irregular writing were traced on the
paper. He did not see what was written, nor did
F.B.B. decipher it until complete. The agreed
method was to remain passive, avoid concentration
of the mind on the subject of the writing, and
to talk casually of other and indifferent matters,
and this was done. The writing turned out to be
a sort of abstract dictum&mdash;viz.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All knowledge is eternal and is available to mental
sympathy."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then followed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was not in sympathy with monks&mdash;I cannot find
a monk yet."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>F.B.B. suggested that one of their living monk-friends
might be a sympathetic link, and the
writing was resumed. After a short interval
J.A.'s hand moved and began to trace a line, ultimately
making a drawing which on inspection
looked like a recumbent cross, but which when
examined proved to be a fairly correct outline
of the main features of the Abbey Church traced
by a single continuous line, but at the east was
a long rectangular addition, nearly as long again
as the quire, and this was given in a double line
as though to emphasise it. Down the middle of
the plan were written the words&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<b>Gulielmus Monachus.</b>" (See Fig. <a href="#Fig_4">4</a>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Next followed what appeared to be an elaborate
plan of the great enclosure of the Abbey Church,
with a sketch of a central tower, with square
pinnacled top, a west front or gabled façade, with
two peaked turrets and a large arched light between.
Across the middle of the surrounding enclosure
a line was drawn, and at one point something
like an ornamental turret with two curved
diverging lines below appeared, and the words,
"linea bifurcata"<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> were written. Then something
looking like a gabled building was sketched, from
which a line was traced to two rows of arches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
perhaps representing a cloister, and thence another
straight line to a drawing recognised as being
intended for St. Mary's Chapel, and approaching
it from the south. The plan of the chapel showed
a large square projection (? turret) on the south,
and two doors on the north side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_4"></a>Fig. 4.&mdash;The Plan of the Abbey Church with the Edgar Chapel
to the East (Left Hand).</span></div>
</div>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The drawing has all the marks of a blindfold tracing.
The line is continuous, commencing at A, and the north
transept is first drawn, very small. Next the line runs east,
and the north-east angle of the retro-quire is traced, and,
following this, the Edgar Chapel, extending east for about
half the length of the quire. Here the line is drawn three
times over, as though to emphasise the feature, and it then
returns over the old ground, the north transept being again
drawn, but larger and further removed, and the whole outline
of the church is completed, to the junction south-west
of the Edgar Chapel, ending with the signature <span class="smcap">Gulielmus
Monachus</span> (William the Monk).</p>



<blockquote>

<p><i>Q.</i> (<i>by F.B.B.</i>). "<i>What does this drawing represent?</i>"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Guest Hall ... St. Maria Capella ... Rolf
monachus."</p></blockquote>

<p>The first drawing was now examined, and both
F.B.B. and J.A. expressed a view unfavourable to
the possibility of so large a chapel at the east of
the church. It was resolved to try again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>F.B.B. "<i>Please give us a more careful drawing of the
chapel sketched just now at the east end of the great
church.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>In reply, a new sketch of the rectangular chapel
was given (see Fig. <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>), with an attempt to indicate
the position of two smaller chapels on the north.
Again the line was drawn double, and below was
written the following, in cramped characters not
easy to decipher:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Capella St. Edgar. Abbas Beere fecit hanc capellam
Beati Edgari ... martyri et hic edificavit vel
fecit voltam ... fecit voltam petriam quod vocatur

<p>F.B.B. "<i>Please repeat; we cannot read this.</i>"</p>

<p>(<i>Repeated.</i>) "Quinquaginta<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> virgas et fenestrae transomatae."</p></blockquote>

</div>


<p class="hang">The line starts at the east, and again it is repeated for emphasis.
The chapel is shown at first, clear of the east wall, but there
is a subsequent loss of position which brings the little chapels
beyond their prescribed limit and makes the plan appear
confused. Below is written "Capella St. Edgar, Abbas
Beere fecit hanc capellam" (Chapel of Saint Edgar, Abbot
Beere built this chapel).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>F.B.B. "<i>Please give length again.</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "30 virgas ... et fenestrae (cum) lapide horizontali

<p>F.B.B. "<i>Which Abbot did this?</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Ricar(d)us Whitting.... Ego Johannes Bryant

<p>This concluded the sitting.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING II. 11th November, 1907, 1 p.m.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The material influences were at fault when last ...
I think active influences were overpowering my will.

<p>Here the influence changes.</p>

repeated, F.B.B. felt curious to know how far
this dramatisation or memory of a personality
might be developed.</p>

<p class="center">NOTE ON THE FIRST THREE SITTINGS.</p>

<p>We observe in these communications an individual
tone, as of a directing influence, at first
manifesting without intermediate links, but almost
immediately yielding place to the monkish elements
introducing themselves as "Gulielmus
Monachus," "Rolf Monachus," and "Johannes
Bryant." There appears something like a clash
of intention, a strain which reacts on the physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
condition of the sitters, and which seems to account
for the rapid exhaustion of power towards the end
of the first sitting, and the consequent lack of
clearness and consistency in the results.</p>

<p>In the second sitting the directive agency
speaks of the monks as "active influences"&mdash;an
expression to be noted. And it is explained that
"the material influences were at fault." Then in
the third sitting we get, "I think I am wrong in
some things. Other influences cross my own."</p>

<p>It seems very much like a man trying to make
a trunk call on a telephone, who is worried because
the local office will either persist in switching him
off at critical moments, or else because the wires
are out of order and imperfectly isolated, so that
fragments of other conversation are interjected.</p>

<p>When we come to consider the matter of
the monkish communications, under the name
Johannes, we are at once confronted by the question,
"Is this a piece of actual experience transmitted
by a real personality, or are we in contact
with a larger field of memory, a cosmic record
latent, yet living (the "eternal knowledge" of
the first writing we record), and able to find expression
in human terms related to the subject
before us, by the aid of something furnished by
the culture of our own minds, and by the aid of a
certain power of mental sympathy which allows
such records to be sensed and articulated?"</p>

<p>As to this, it is too early to dogmatise, but in
either case room must be left for the presence of
a Directive Power accessible to man, capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
stimulating and energising dormant consciousness,
and directing it into such channels as man has
developed for its reception and expression.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING IV. 19th November, 1907.</p>

<p>The result was interesting, but contained nothing
important as regards the Abbey.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING V. 22nd November, 1907.</p>

<p>A further plan was produced of the general
range of Abbey buildings, signed "Johannes."
This was followed by a short script as here given:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When you dig, excavate the pillars of the crypt, six
feet below the grass&mdash;they will give you a clue. The
direction of the walls ... eastwards (<i>this word might
almost as easily have been 'westwards,' or even 'outwards,'
and it was so ill written that nothing could be decided from it</i>)
... was at an angle ... clothyards twenty seven long,
nineteen wide."</p></blockquote>

<p>It would have been just as easy to read the last
as "thirteen." The pencilled original of the plan
is preserved, but not the script, as it was not regarded
as of value at the time, but the mention
of the "walls at an angle," referring, as it would
appear, to some part of the chapel whose dimensions
are in the context, is an interesting point.</p>

<p>The mention of the crypt seemed simply the
mentality of the sitters&mdash;a reflex of their study
of Wild's plan. It is again referred to, however,
in later writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p class="center">SITTING VI. 26th November, 1907.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>F.B.B. "<i>Perhaps Johannes will tell us something more?</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Johannes Bryant is striving for the glory of Glaston.
There is much under the grass deep down and unrifled.
The east of St. Mary's has a vault under the stairs and under
the nave there are vaults<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>&mdash;the destroyers feared, and the
ruin of the walls hid the entrance in. Under the tower
the volt is perfect, and many names of those buried therein
very deep down."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> "<i>Where should we commence to dig?</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "The east end. Seek for the pillars, and the
wall(s) at an angle. The foundations are deep."</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">SITTING IX. 30th December, 1907.</p>

<p>Commencement of writing quite illegible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... (the) end of the time approaches. The year is

<p>"... For greater things will rise into being&mdash;great
nations and great ideals. We work for it. Be willing,

Earth and spirit mingle not. Losing earthly

your wares, but listen for the still small voice in the silence
of your chamber. Work in the sun. Listen in the
starlight...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Both F.B.B. and J.A. expressed a good deal
of surprise at the nature of the first part of
this communication, as any idea of impending
revolution in Church or State had been utterly
remote from our minds and not in any way the
subject of conversation. The passage was an
intrusion and a puzzle. But we did not regard
it as of any special interest; more as a curiosity
for which a psychological explanation was lacking.</p>

<p>Later there occurred more such intrusions,
pointing with increasing definiteness to the nature
of that which we were warned to anticipate, but
they belong to another story and have no connection
with the discovery of the Edgar Chapel.
Hence the record of many sittings will be omitted,
and we pass to the nineteenth, held 19th February,
1908, after a visit to the Abbey. F.B.B. had not
yet received his appointment, but was steadily
preparing, and at the moment was engaged in
working out the probable appearance of the approaches
to the central chapel of the retro-quire,
and the work of Bere's time had been discussed.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;All the 1907 sittings were at Bristol.
The next to be recorded (Sitting XIX.) was held
at Glastonbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p class="center">SITTING XIX. 19th February, 1908. At Glaston</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The arche is flatte&mdash;three ells from side to side&mdash;ten

<p>"... we have told you long tyme sins&mdash;panellae everywhere

<p>"Two capellae north and south and between them a
greate space with a tall doore in the midst, of four centres,
all panelled under ye fann-tracery over ye lintel. And
there were two altares on either side and much carven
woode very blacke which was took away for the panellae.
And the holes in ye walls were covered with the panellae
so that they shewed not, and yt was all of stone very white
and faire and in ye doore was a greate stairway with two
windowes on either hand that did rise one above the other
of equal height above ye stairway.... And ye stairway
was divided in ye midst by a grete rail of stone so that
they who went upp might not meet with they who came
down ye said stair.</p>

<p>"And beyond rose a Capella of Edgar ye sainte, faire
and high with grete windowes with transomes and between
ye windowes were pillars as panellae the whych did holde
ye roofe of stone vaultid very faire in panellae which were
fanwise very fine much like carven yvorie and carvings
ypainted in ye bosses and in ye spandrels and there was a
grete windowe in ye est parte of eight lights all ye arches
and ye roofe being flatte as of the period and the chamber
was yflagged with tiles of many colours and in ye midst

for hyt was darke.</p>

<p>"Forty and two feete was the hight of ye newe chapelle
and yt was ybuttressed with faire buttresses and walls
slantwise at ye cornere."</p></blockquote>

<p>There appears throughout this communication
a tendency to older forms of spelling never quite
achieved, and constantly slipping back into the
normal. The phrasing seems more consistently
old-fashioned.</p>

<p>Note the further reference to "walls slantwise
at ye cornere," recalling the "walls at an angle"
mentioned in an earlier script.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XXIV. 5th March, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... Wold I could tell you of the great Est window

<p>"The buildings on the south side of the east end were
two. One was a chapell, the other for the priest to robe in.</p>

<p>"Saint Edgar was buried in the window where ye see
the cross. Afterwards Beer moved him to the new chapell
that he builded. Chapell was like unto Wells but more
faire."</p></blockquote>

<p>This obviously alludes to Bishop Stillington's
Chapel, a fan-vaulted structure of rich sixteenth-century
work, now destroyed.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XXV. 10th March, 1908.</p>

<p>F.B.B. obtained the appointment as representative

<p>The identity of this Reginald is not clear.
Bishop Reginald of Wells, who consecrated the
Chapel of St. Mary at Glastonbury, died in 1191
according to the chronicles. The Chapel is said
to have been completed in 1216.</p>

<p>
"ROBERT. ANNO 1334. GLASTON."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">NOTE ON SITTING XXIX.</p>

<p>The blending of influences is again very marked,
but the dominant thought is that of one of the
inmates of the great abbatial House. The signature
"Robert" (anno 1334) does not help us.
This was the year that witnessed the election of
John de Breynton as Abbot, vice Adam de Sodbury,
and it was an era of great building activities.
But Robert speaks, or is made to speak,
for those of an era two hundred years later, or
nearly, and it is strange to find a voice from the
fourteenth century recalling the "window" as it
then was, and going on to describe alterations
made at the beginning of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>And the allusion to Abbot Beere's living influence
is of peculiar interest. Among the best
modern exponents of the Gothic English styles,
the call of the past, and the influence of the past,
is vital as an element in their work, and it is precisely
in the measure in which they are able to
translate the spirit of the past, that they can claim
inspiration in what they strive to produce.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Occasionally a sincere student will obtain some
mental pictures of a bygone time of singular clearness
and fidelity, whence, he knows not; only that
they are spontaneously apparent to him <em>when in a</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
<em>state of mental passivity after intellectual exertion in
the particular direction needed</em>. It may be of interest
here to quote an experience once related to
the writer by an old friend, W., now retired from
practice, but who in the 80's of the last century
was responsible for a good deal of scholarly restoration
work in the west country. W. was very
partial to the Early English forms, and if he had
a fault, it was the fault of his day, when restorers
were a little ruthless, as we should think nowadays,
in substituting Early English detail for the
fifteenth century "vernacular" of the district.
On one occasion he was called upon to undertake
"restoration"&mdash;which, in this case, meant a
partial rebuilding&mdash;of a decayed church in the
very decayed town of I. The south wall of the
nave, a work of the ordinary "Perpendicular"
sort, had to be rebuilt, and he had to construct a
new arcade for the aisle adjoining. Somehow he
felt disinclined to do this in the fifteenth-century
style, but was prompted to design afresh, in the
manner of the thirteenth. And for his pillars he
imagined a form of capital having rather a complex
moulding. There was nothing visible to
guide him, but it appealed to him as suitable.
Nor was it a local type&mdash;at least, this would be the
writer's recollection of the impression he derived
from the drawing which W. showed him.</p>

<p>The capitals were provided of this pattern, the
old wall was pulled down, and hidden within it
and built into its substance was found <em>a pier-capital
of a moulding identical in detail</em>. I myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
was satisfied that he had never seen any particle
of this early work, and he allows me to retell the
story here. As to the story of Johannes, the
truant monk and nature-lover, it takes the
form of an interpretation of his memory-record
by another. Whether we are dealing with a
singularly vivid imaginative picture or with the
personality of a man no one can really decide.
But later examples will elucidate the part he
plays in the scheme, and it is one of much interest
from the psychological point of view.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XXIX.&mdash;<i>Continued.</i> 20th April, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ye crypt was mere a chamber under the stairs and it
was at the west end of the chapel. It was not for sepulture
and it is gone long syne by reason of the fall of the floor
of ye chapel.</p>

<p>"Yt wasne underground and was low&mdash;a man might
hardly walk sans stooping."</p></blockquote>

<p>The work of excavation commenced shortly
after the receipt of this communication.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XXXII. 16th June, 1908 (after excavation
No. 4).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All is well. We direct your course and will continue.
There is some difficulty and ye must use your own intelligence.
There are two chapels and ye must try and judge
old and new. The scheme of Abbot Monington gave one,
and under the church are remains yet older. The pillar
of many shafts<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> was in the midst between the buttress and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the chapel wall, and the great window needed the buttress
to hold hym up. Seek out the choir wall, where the
arches were behind the altar, and it will be plaine. Digge
for the vestries on the south choir wall&mdash;there is somewhat
left here, and there is alsoe a chantry under the window
by the crosse.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>"Judge not the wall by the foundations thereof. They
are mighty but&mdash;wee have told you&mdash;thin walls were over
them.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>"Search far for the est end of Edgar's Chapel. It is
but little damaged. S. Mary and S. Andrew's Chapels,
over the ends of ye choir aisles."</p></blockquote>

<p>The only reminiscence of a retro-chapel is to
be found in the plan of the Abbey embodied
in Phelps's <cite>Somerset</cite>, reproduced by Warner.
Phelps shows a dotted-line extension of the east
wall of the retro-quire of nearly the same projection
as Willis's plan, but in this case it ends with
a semicircle&mdash;a feature impossible for anything
but a Norman chapel, which here would be out
of the question. In a corner of Phelps's plan
appears a similar diagram, but with the rectangular
part much lengthened. Both are lettered "F,"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
and the reference table gives "F" = Lady's Chapel.
Warner copies this plan, calling this latter one
"the Chapel according to its original dimensions."
Neither F.B.B. nor J.A. had at that time seen
Warner's copy of Phelps's plan, because the copy
of Warner accessible to them in the Bristol Public
Library had lost this sheet. But owing to the
general haziness of the plan, and its numerous
inaccuracies, and the entirely impossible suggestion
of a semicircular apse (in a dotted-line figure), as
well as owing to the suggestion "Lady's Chapel,"
these records had proved the reverse of illuminating,
save as inspiring a guess that the original
and shorter quire might very likely have been furnished
with a Lady Chapel, for use in the remote
days, before the western chapel of St. Mary had
been opened up and thrown into the general series
by the inclusion of the "Galilee"&mdash;a work of
the fourteenth century, and that this Lady Chapel
had been ultimately shorn of the greater part of
its length by its absorption into the new retro-quire,
what time Abbot Monington caused the
quire to be lengthened by two bays (about 40 feet)
<i>temp.</i> 1344 or thereabouts. Such an hypothesis
would entail the deduction that after the lengthening
of the retro-quire in the fourteenth century,
there would remain at the east end a relatively
short projection&mdash;say, of 12 feet or so&mdash;and some
such reasoning may well have inspired Willis's
scheme (see his plan in the <cite>Architectural History of
Glastonbury Abbey</cite>), though he rightly rejected the
semicircle as an eastern finish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q.</i> "<i>Was there any crypt under Edgar's Chapel? What
were the clear dimensions of the chapel itself?</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "The cript is fallen in, but the clay is not the old
clay. Clear out the midst thereof, and many fragments
be there. The width ye shall find is twenty and seven,
and outside, thirty and four, so we remember.</p>

<p>
"BEERE, <i>Abbas</i>."<br />
</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> "<i>What was the clear internal length of the chapel?</i>"</p>

<p>A. "Wee laid down seventy and two, but they builded
longer, and he who followed made new schemes for a
certaine roofe in golde and crimson, very cunning. Ye
must use your talents, lest they weaken. Piece by piece
ye shall rebuild it and there is enow, I wot, for ye.</p>

<p>"Digge east beyond the beds of feathered grasses. There
was a passage to the east doore in ye walle to the streete.
In the midst it remaineth. There was a lodging where
now is the great howse, and wee loved passages. They
were safe, and the priesthood loveth secret places. There
is somewhat in us that loveth mystical things, so we tell
not all, but leave it to the love which seeketh and is not
wearied."<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the time of this writing, only the west end
of the chapel had been excavated, so that the
length was still a matter of complete doubt.
A massive wall running north and south had been
found just about in the position of that shown
as a projection in Willis's plan&mdash;namely, about
12 feet east of the walls of the retro-quire, and on
the farther side of this the foundations commenced
at a much higher level, indicative of a later
extension by Bere from this point onwards. And
the whole of this cross-wall must have been Bere's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
work, for it ran north and south for some 32 feet,
and beyond that came the projection of its buttresses.
When the continuation walls of the chapel
to the east were further revealed, the clear width
between their footings was about 18 feet, and as
they were each about 6 feet 6 inches in width, the
whole was not quite 32. So the suggestion in the
script of a clear internal width to this chapel of
27 feet is by no means improbable if measured
into the window recesses. As to the length given
(72 feet), a total of 90 had already been spoken
of, so that the 72 must represent the rectangular
portion of the chapel, <em>plus</em> either the antechapel
or the eastward extension only, either of which
give this approximate total.</p>

<p>As afterwards revealed (see plan in <cite>Som. Arch.
Soc. Proc.</cite> for 1908), the correspondence proved
to be faithful, as the scale shows. Measure from
the interior of the east wall of the retro-quire,
which will include all the space within the antechapel
of Bere's work, eastwards to the end of his
rectangular walls, and the whole is close on 72 feet&mdash;viz.,
12 + 5 + 50 + 5 in approximate measures.</p>

<p>There were several clumps of pampas grass
on the high bank, but farther east than our advance
at the moment. Another fragment of
script, unfortunately now lost, again referred to one
of the clumps on the south side, as being just west
of a large mass of masonry. This was correct.
The large mass in question is that which stands
up high above the rest at the south-east angle of
the rectangular chapel. Again, we have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
curious and unusual suggestion of an east door
to the chapel (compare the "Portus introitus post
reredos," etc.). When, long subsequently, the
two inclined walls of the apse were revealed, the
gap in the middle was remarked. The footing on
the north side of the eastern gap was cut squarely
off, and evidently by intention, and was thus
strongly suggestive of a doorway or archway here.</p>

<p>In "the walle to the streete" we may perhaps
discern an explanation of the continuation of the
angular wall on the south, which runs on for a
distance not yet ascertained in the direction of
the upper part of the town, and would have passed
near the building which formerly occupied the
site of the present Abbey House.</p>

<p>It was not until several months later that
the whole of Bere's rectangular chapel was
disclosed. The bank increased in height as we
proceeded east. But the farther we went, the
more stone we found on the south side, until at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
last, at the south-east corner, a block of solid
masonry was uncovered which rose several feet
above the general level. And to the south of the
last two buttresses on this side there came to
light the trench or matrix of a small additional
building, a chantry or a sacristy. These trenches
were cleared and filled with solid concrete to preserve
the record of the lost walls, which must otherwise
have perished through the falling-in of the
loose and crumbling earth.</p>

<p>"The ending of the chappel was at an angle, the sides
makyng as it were a baye in the east wall there. The last
bay to the east hayde an arche like unto a chancel arche and
with a feather ornament, as hadde all the other arches; and
the space beyond into the baye was as it were three fannes
with thin pillars running up the angles and spreading
toward the arche. In the three faces of the east wall
were three windowes, and all this was faire made by Abbot
Whitting, who lengthened Edgar's Chappel somewhat,
to the extent of half a bay.... The fannes are flat

fitted together.</p>

<p>"The lytell chantry was roofed in pannels by ...

<p>This script was obtained before the angular
walls of the apse had been found. The description
generally is quite a plausible one, and there
is good reason for thinking that the apse would
have been finished by the last Abbot (Whiting).
Some stones of the fan-work were found at the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
of the year. The "little chantry" would seem to
refer to the projecting footings found between
the last two buttresses on the south side. It compares
again with Gloucester Lady Chapel, where
such additions are found north and south of the
fourth bay from the west.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn of 1908 the
work of excavation had been steadily continued.
By December practically the whole of the
rectangular portion of Beere's chapel had been
laid bare, and proved to be of four bays, in
accordance with the script. The excavation
of the antechapel entirely confirmed Willis's
view of the divisions of the retro-quire, and,
strange to say, justified his plan in regard to
the length of the central projection, for it was
abundantly clear from the appearance of the two
flanking walls (or, rather, their foundations) that
there had been an original projection here of the
same extent as he showed, and that Beere had
merely taken on at this point and started his new
work with a massive cross-wall at a different level.
The footings of the north and south walls of Beere's
chapel were about 6 feet 6 inches broad and a little
over 18 feet apart in the clear. The thin Perpendicular
work above would normally stand rather
over the outer margin of the footings to allow
of the projecting piers supporting the fans of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
roof, and this would entirely justify a computation
of width approaching 27 feet clear into the
recesses of windows. But the total internal
length on the foundations between east and west
footings measured 49 feet, a dimension in itself
insufficient to justify the 70 feet claimed in the
script, even if it were considered that part of the
breadth on the west footing, and an even larger
part on the east footing must be included in the
interior area of the chapel. Possibly a further
6 feet or so might be allowed for these margins,
making a total internal length for the rectangular
chapel of 55 feet, to which another 15 feet must
be added if the measurement of 70 feet given in the
script were to be justified.</p>

<p>But the rectangular chapel ended off with a
proper finish to the east, and the two return
buttresses were well marked. At this point the
digging had been very deep, as the level of the
bank rises steadily from west to east, and we were
now about 10 feet under the grass level. The
rectangular end was cleared, and before us rose
a sheer face of clay without trace of any continuance.
Nothing had yet been seen of "walls at an
angle," and the writer scanned the face of the clay
many times, trying to detect any signs of disturbance
or of a further junction of building, and so
matters remained till the end of December.</p>

<p>In the meantime a report had been prepared
for the annual volume of <cite>Proceedings of the Somerset
Arch. Soc.</cite>, and as by this time F.B.B. was fully
persuaded that Hearne and Hollar are giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
us fact when they state that the total length of
the Abbey was 580 feet, he boldly drew a plan of
the excavated chapel with an addition in dotted
lines, making out the requisite dimension and
<em>showing a polygonal annexe or apse</em>, and this he
caused to be published in the 1908 <cite>Proceedings</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_6"></a>Fig. 6.</span></div>
</div>

<p>During the Christmas holidays F.B.B. again
visited the site, and on a bright sunny day looked
at the clay bank, and for the first time detected a
small squarish patch of pale brown discoloration in
the clay at a level much higher than the footings of
the chapel. He caused the face to be cut into at
this point, which was nearly opposite the southern
return buttress, and at a point about 2 feet within
the clay face the stump of a wall appeared. This
was traced and proved to run north-east at an
angle of 67 degrees from the north and south axis
of the chapel.</p>

<p>The ground was opened in the corresponding
position on the north side, and here a trench was
found well and truly cut in the clay, and filled
with debris of sixteenth-century freestone, tile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and glass fragments, chiefly of painted work, and
largely of azure blue.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> The footing-trench was
inclined at a similar angle, but instead of meeting
a cross wall at east, it stopped short at the point
where such a return wall should be, and this indicated
that in all probability the annexe had a
door in the east wall,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> behind the reredos, suggestive
of the use of this part as a feretory or relic-chamber,
and this recalls almost exactly the plan
of the church (collegiate) of Westbury-on-Trym,
which is also furnished with a semi-hexagonal apse.</p>

<p>Calculating that the inner faces of the three
walls of this annexe would have been designed to
be more or less equal in breadth, for sake of symmetry,
a line was struck across the apse at the required
point, a stake put in, and a very careful
chain-measure made from end to end of the whole
range of Abbey buildings&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, from the internal
face of the Lady Chapel or Church of St. Mary at
the west, to this point, and the measure was then
found to be <em>precisely 580 feet, as given by Hearne
and Hollar</em>. The true plan of the chapel was
published in the 1909 volume of <cite>Proceedings</cite>, and
makes an interesting comparison with the conjectural
plan (see Fig. <a href="#Fig_7">7</a>, p. 64).</p>

<p>Two years later, in the collection of Colonel
Wm. Long, J.P., of Clevedon, an eighteenth-century
manuscript plan of the ruins, hitherto
quite unknown, came to light, and was found to
show the two inclined wall-sections of the apse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
of the Edgar Chapel. A note attached to this
plan gives the extreme dimensions of the chapel
as 87 feet by 49 feet. The latter would only be
correct if it included the little chantry projecting
on the south side. It would not represent the true
outside measure of the chapel proper, which is
elsewhere stated as 34 feet, and must have
approximated to that width.</p>

<p>Eighty-seven feet is of course fairly correct
as an internal measure of length, and thus substantiates
the record.</p>

<p>The blackened wattlework was found at a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
depth in the clay near the south-east corner of the
Edgar Chapel. It was examined together with
other remains, and reported on by Mr. St. George
Gray in the <cite>Proceedings of the Somerset Archæological
Society</cite> for 1909. No attempt has been
made to explore the site beyond the eastward
limit of the Chapel. The ground is very deep, and
there are other difficulties. As the proved internal
length of the Abbey with the Chapel is 580 feet,
this measure of 628 feet would imply another
large addition, and in the absence of any sort of
evidence of its probability, it is impossible to
attach the least weight to it.</p>

"Permultae memoriae."<br />
</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">SITTING, 1st September, 1910.</p>

<p>The script begins in a cramped hand, very disjointed
and confused. It is mostly in Latin words,
and we trace the name of one John of Aller, in
the rural district of Somerset ("in agros Somersetiae"),
formerly a husbandman, but later a
watchman at the Abbey. But he cannot tell us
what he would, and the power which should recall
his memories fails. "Nescio quid sum," it ends,
"aut inde veni."</p>

<p>Then the writing commences afresh, thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ambrosius the Cellarius wold speke to ye. And hee
isne a scholar. Ye binnes in ye cellar ye wot they were
full of good wine, but ye cellars of ye Guesten Hall lye
deeper downe.</p>

<p>"Ye roofe of ym<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> is but even with ye floor of hym. But
I wot they have left ye little enow.</p>

<p>"Ye Abbot's lyttell kitchen he lay in between ye two
halles, and ye cooke hadde enow to feed them on the one
syde and alsoe ye guesten folk on ye other. Therefore
ybuilded ye Abbot ye grete Kitchen afore ye Howse, for
to make feast on grete feast-dayes. Ye olde kitchens and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
ye minte-garden wasne used much after that. Ye newe
howse of ye Abbot hadde kitchens enow, and soe....
Know ye ye lytell cloystere ahint ye Prior's Lodging and ye
Halle convent over against the Stabels of ye horses?
They were near ye Guest Halle on ye syde of our Lord
Abbat's Howse, and ye menne lay over them. There were
foure horses, and rooms for ye guesten horses in ye same
stable."</p></blockquote>

<p>The script here deals with an area still unexcavated,
as to which we have but little documentary
evidence. The position of the Guest Hall may be
reasonably inferred to be on the site suggested,
due west from the Refectory. The statement about
the kitchens seems reasonable. At this point
the communication under the name Ambrosius
ceases and an entirely different handwriting is
noted. The script continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ricardus de Tanton, who did make ye drawings for
my Abbot Bere, wold tell you that which Ambrosius can
not."</p></blockquote>

<p>We gather that the level of the ground was
lowered and four cellars made for storing wine for
the Guest Hall above. Next we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The grete Halle was ybuilded not long syne, and ye
must goe where the kitchens did joyne him to the Refectorium.
Aufwold says that the convent of Arimathia
was at hys south-west corner, builded long tyme since, and
there was as it were a little cloystere between the Hall
and the chapel where Beere did saye masse. The stabel
was over aganst the Abbat's new howse which Beere
builded, and which was in front of the Guest Hall but away
from hym. The crypt under the new Hall was deeper
downe. His roofe was near level to the floore of the
vault of the Refectorium....</p>

<p>"Goe you through the grete door at ye corner of ye
Cloyster on ye est syde downe XII steppes and on through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
ye passage-waye. Then shall ye rise uppe ye steppes IX on
ye south syde, and soe acrosse ye mint garden to the Newe
Halle where was a doore, and through hym cometh a
passage to the further syde and soe to the lyttel cloyster,
and beyond hym the lyttel convent and ye lyttel chapel

est of all these places high and stronge, and over hym
was the dormer, and beyond, the parlour beneath and the
scriptorium above hym: and soe unto ye wall of ye lyttle
cloystere, and after a space, a yarde and the schola with
its chappel and buildings around yt ... for ye boyes,
alsoe ye changing room for ye choire who sang in ye

<p>"Ye boyes were ofttimes joyous and did playe and make
a shouting, and ye Abbat sayde: 'Chide not youth in its
playe, but may ye keepe them afar from ye claustre places
lest they weary my devowte,'&mdash;and so ye schola was far

Phelps has preserved a reminiscence
of this chapel, and he suggests
a semicircular end, which

Glastonbury</i> <i>written to F.B.B.

About 12 feet beyond the retro-quire,
the levels of the ground and
foundations rise considerably. At
this point comes the west wall of
the Edgar Chapel; and the same
point probably marks the extreme
eastward limit of the older
Lady Chapel.

<p>"... As to your record of the script, it
would be most interesting if you were to publish
it. There is no question but that the writing
about the Edgar Chapel preceded the discovery
of it by many months. I was present, if you remember,
at what I believe was the beginning of
the recrudescence of&mdash;&mdash; 's automatism, ...
and that was before you ever started your work
at Glastonbury, and before you were even appointed
to the work. I remember your telling
me when you were appointed, how interesting it
was, as you were then able to test some of the
statements made.</p>

<p>"No, there is no doubt whatever in my mind
on that point; you will remember that the only
doubt I have ever expressed was on the question
as to how far something in one of the books on
Glastonbury which you showed me afterwards,
and which might have suggested the possibility
of the actual position of the Edgar Chapel, might
conceivably have influenced&mdash;&mdash; 's mind subconsciously;
I forget what book it was, but I remember
it was not the book which was taken at
that time as the most authoritative."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Signed Statement of J.A.</span></p>

<p>"I, the undersigned J&mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;&mdash;, hereby certify
that I am the J.A. referred to in Mr. Bligh
Bond's account of the automatic writings concerning
Glastonbury Abbey and other matters, and
that the transcript which he has made of the
series of about fifty communications dating from
7th November, 1907, to 30th November, 1911,
and also some supplementary writings produced
in 1912 and later, appears to me correct so far
as the same could be deciphered by us. I furthermore
affirm that the writings were produced
through my hand, but without knowledge of their
nature or purport, and contain conclusions which
I could not have arrived at normally, and which
in many cases&mdash;as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the case of the Edgar
Chapel&mdash;were such as appeared to me most improbable,
and were deemed fanciful until further
research had elucidated points then obscure. My
knowledge and reading were confined to documents
which have been accessible to all students
of the Abbey, and I had no unique source of information.
The writings were produced often
whilst my normal attention was devoted to other
matters, and promiscuous conversation at these
times was our rule. I held the pencil and Mr.
Bond laid his fingers on the back of my hand or
lightly grasped it. He did not direct it. There
was nothing in my knowledge or experience that
I know of to suggest the names of Bryant and
others which are appended to the writings. Even
the possible meaning of such a name as Manumetaxyl
was unknown to me.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>"I am disposed to concur with Mr. Bond in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
view that the subconscious part of the mind may
in its operation traverse the limitations of individual
knowledge, either acting telepathically
through contact with some larger field of memory,
or as itself part of a larger unit of a more pervasive
kind as regards time and space, conditions which
would imply that the individual may have powers
of self-expression far greater than those which
are normally available through the brain-mechanism
controlled by the will and logical faculties.</p>

<h3 id="THE_CHILD_OF_NATURE">THE CHILD OF NATURE</h3>


<p>Johannes&mdash;who is he? The child of our dreams?
Or a name inscribed in the great roll of those who
were, and now are not?</p>

<p>No previous knowledge of surname or circumstance,
either in history or fiction, can be traced as
a source of the idea underlying this dramatisation
of a personality in many respects so sympathetic
and so true to nature.</p>

<p>Yet again and again he speaks, or is spoken for,
in the writings, and his simplicity of character is
maintained. And he became to us more than a
name, one vested with reality, even as it is said
of a well-known author, that his characterisations
dwelt in his consciousness as living folk. And we
never knew when his advent might be expected,
nor what sort of message he would have for us.
Frequently it happened that in sitting down to
writing some expectation or desire would be expressed
for information on certain lines, but the
script would negative this expectation, and either
give us something new and quite unexpected, or
else, as often happened, take up the thread of a
previous communication broken off several days,
or even months before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... He ever loved the woods and the pleasant places
which lie without our house. It was good, for he learnt
in the temple of nature much that he would never hear
in choro. His herte was of the country and he heard
it calling without the walls and the Abbot winked at it
for he knew full well that it was good for him. He went
a-fishing, did Johannes, and tarried oft in lanes to listen
to the birds and to watch the shadows lengthening over all
the woods of Mere.</p>

<p>"He loved them well, and many times no fish had he,
for that he had forgot them ... but we cared not, for he
came with talk and pleasant converse, as nutbrown ale,
and it was well.</p>

<p>"And because he was of nature his soul was pure and he
is of the Company that doth watch and wait for the glories
to be renewed."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was in the fourth sitting that Johannes, instead
of being the spokesman, was spoken for.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Gulielmus de Glaston shall speke ... hath spoken
of his tyme, and Johannes wold speke of hys time. The
older tyme wasne known to hym. My punishment is past,
but Johannes is yet in pain."</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">SITTING XI. 4th January, 1908.</p>

<p>At this sitting Johannes speaks for another, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... wold say, 'Seek ye goal and ensue it. Ne walke
in circles as somme doe. Many objects distract ye minde.
Seeke one goal and wynne all.</p>

<p>
"JOHANNES DE GLASTON."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In response to a question about two friends:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dreme. To them is to dreme, not labour. Seek
visions. Be constant in mind.</p>

<p>"That wych cometh, doe. Wee may not say more.
To you is to choose. Opus spiriti, non opus terrae est.
Ye are rich, but not in goodes. Work at that which
comes."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p class="center">SITTING XVIII. 18th February, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Stande ye, and be as waxe in oure hands. Listen, and
ye shall heare. I, Johannes, say soe. Be patient and
yielding. Listen for our voices in choro mid. Ye shall
heare them, and much more, but persevere: great things
shall come to pass ere ye join the Company. Goe ye and
prosper for us and you. Wee waite where wee wold bee.</p>

<p>
"JOHANNES."<br />
</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">SITTING XXVI. 12th March, 1908.</p>

<p>This communication bears the names of others
besides Johannes, but is included owing to its
interesting nature.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The horloge as ye face the wall lieth on the right, six
elles or more above the floor. The stair in the right towret
led from ye cloister to it, to wind hym every day at matins.</p>

<p>"I, Galfrith, knew in my day. They who came spake
in Latin, and not all knew the wisdom hid in the british
tongue, nor eke the saxon. Some were wrote again,
but the fathers were more sought than the Bards and
much was hearsay.</p>

<p>"What do ye long after, my son? The memory of
man is but as the grass that fadeth, and they who would
fain translate the word of the barbarian oft inserted what
they desired but would not an they could (<i>? translate truly</i>).
The hidden meaning they knew not which looked for the
husk which covered it and soe much was lost for all
tyme. The merlins spoke in what ye call an allegory,
but the parable was what these fathers read, not the
mystery.</p>

<p>"Those who would tell you of the glory of our howse
all strive together, Saxon, Norman, and native, so which
wold ye have&mdash;Norman base or later Abbey?</p>

<p>"Ye see the howse in its first condition, and like a
falling lace, the dremes of later men obscure it. The first
dreme improved&mdash;it was complete, and the grete church
as it stood when Jocelyn came is what ye wish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>"Then, when they were building at Welles, we were
jealous of our howse, and certain masons coming on
holiday across the causeway which led straight across the
marsh, did tell us we were lacking. They sedde our
howse was over smalle for our community, and the choir
thereof was not long enow for our processions and for
the brethren to sitte at the service of the church&mdash;for we
were three hundred and forty-seven in number. And
moreover the towre was too lowe for beauty. And Wells
being new and faire with carven stone, our Abbot was
moved to beautify our howse. Soe he that was at enmity
with Jocelyn, made friends that day, and the Bishop with
a fair company came on a white palfrey and did dine
with us. And so was our choir enlonged and afterwards
the towre was beautifyed with certain panelling, and this
although our coffers were much in need because the body
of the church was newly yfinished by very faire art.</p>

<p>"Ye belle Towre that was burnt and new builded was
pulled downe because it was falling (on) ye cloister, for
it was sunken in the foote."</p></blockquote>

<p>The above being far from clearly written, a
repetition of the last sentences was asked for.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nay, my sonne. Have I not told? And ye would
know of ye belle-towre. It was not. I have sedde it
was pulled downe and ne heard of. The gabell was
yfinished like unto Welles, and the clock and certain belles
did hang there.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have sat in the grate gallery under the west
window and watched the pylgrims when the sun went
downe. It was in truth a brave sight, and one to move the
soul of one there. The orgayne that did stande in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
gallery did answer hym that spake on the great screene,
and men were amazed not knowing which did answer
which. Then did ye bellows blowe and ye ... man
who beat with his hands upon the manual did strike
yet harder, and all did shout Te Deums, so that all ye town
heard the noise of the shouting, and ye little orgaynes
in ye chapels did join in the triumph. Then ye belles
did ring and we thought hyt must have gone to ye gates of
Heaven. But we know not now, for there were sinnes,
and the frailties and pomps of men are not meet for the
ear of Hym that dwelleth in the heavens."</p></blockquote>

<p>(Here follows a reference to a certain Radulphus,
whose story had been previously given.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"More we will serche in the great army of past things&mdash;they
are soe hard to find."</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">SITTING XL. 15th October, 1909 (shortly after the
excavation of the corner of the vault beneath the
refectory).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... He fell full sore and lay as one dead, and the
King was right merrie. 'See,' he said, 'how heavy lies
the good ale on this poor roysterer.'</p>

<p>"And my Abbot did make penances full sore and many,
so that Johannes had need of drink and good cheere to
help his weakness. '(O) for the full bowle,' quoth he, '...
for one good drink; there is so much amiss.'</p>

<p>"And ye have found the place wherein I lay, and even
now the scent of good ale hangs round the floores. I go,
who have told ye. Peccavi!'</p>

<p>"'Well,' saith Father Abbot, 'ye have disgraced us
before ye Kinge, and he will not remember us in the day
of our adversity.'</p>

<p>"'Nay,' saith Johannes, 'but the Kinge, who was of
an evil choler, was afterwards right merrie because of poor
Johannes and the vat of good ale. Alas! That soe much
of good ale was squandered for a King's pastime!'
Whereat there went more Paternosters and much penance
in claustro. Ye have it. What more wold ye?"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>The foregoing was very difficult to decipher,
and its substance so entirely different from anything
we might have expected, that practically
nothing could at the time be made of it. It was
therefore asked for again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have told ye. Why ask me more? They who
brought the vat of ale pulled hym uppe with a rope, for
ye King called for more brown ale such as we in ye Abbey
were wont to brew. Ye rope broke, and ye King was
merrie, and this I say, gainsay who may, it was not
Johannes and ye ale which destroyed our faire Abbey,
but ye lust of ye King and ye haste which (he had for the
possession) of our house.</p>

<p>"Why did they say that I who soe loved my Abbey, had
compassed its ruin? I didde paternosters for that which
wasne my sinne. Ye rope it broke. Hee was the misdoer.</p>

<p>"Ye Guesten Hall was over against the Monks' Hall,
and there were, as you say, great screenen between the
two tables, and ye Abbate hadde his high table, and likewise
ye Kinge had his, but they had an screne. The
Kinge's party did royster in their cuppes.</p>

<p>"What of ye Hall? Faire tapestry and carven oake,
and six high windowes in the syde of him, and one faire
windowe in ye gables, and under hym a gallery where
were singing men to please the King's majestie, and cunning
minstrelsie. Ye pulpitte was silent&mdash;not homilies, but
the brethren did list to songs of prowess and pleasure
instead of paternosters. But in that pollution was death
to our howse, for the Kinge did lust after our meats and
wines and (cared) not to save us from (the coming doom);
and he whom we trusted, the great Cardinal, was falling,
although we knew it not. 'Wait,' said our Abbot,
'he is our friend who made me Abbot. Ask hym to our
house.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This passage was again very difficult to decipher,
and before anything had been made of it
I asked for it again. J.A. was without any idea
of its contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I did say there were windowes six in ye grete Halle,
and a grete one at the gables, wherein were singing
mennes. I didde sayye that the Kinge lusted after our
Howse and (was covetous) of our good cheere, fit for a
Kinge's majestie. This proved the ruin of our howse,
for hee who made our Abbot was himself falling from
greatness, and could give us no help&mdash;hee, the Cardinal
of Ipswich.</p>

<p>"But ne'er was it Johannes and ye ale!"</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">SITTING XLII. 18th April, 1911.</p>

<p>The foundations of the chapel of St. Dunstan at
the west end of the Lady Chapel had been brought
to light, and were evidently of mixed date&mdash;the
original probably very early.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q. by F.B.B. "Who built St. Dunstan's Chapel?"</i></p>

<p>"Edgarus ybuilded long syne. Radulphus hoc opus
restoravit. After hym ye fyre yburned yt. Then he
was a capella in muro.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>"They say we hadde not hys bonen, but they lie, for we
hadde the leg-bones of hym, and certain smalle bones
which they took to Canterbury, and Johannes knoweth it
of old tyme long syne. They did open the tombe and tooke
them backe. What mean they who said we hadde them
not? They all knew it, and the pilgrimmes did come
from Canterbury by ye old horse-way to venerate them.</p>

<p>"Roof yfallen! Hee of the gatehouse dwelt therein,

Because we all who should obey were meek.

<p class="center">SITTING XLIX. 29th July, 1911.</p>

<p>This little fragment came quite spontaneously
and without anything to lead up to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At night the sound of many waters refreshed ye
parched soil. From tower and from the high roofes
the sound came like the sound of waterfloods, and the
gargoyles shouted each to each, and the cloisters whispered
comfort and refreshment as we lay under the dormer roofe
in parched and sultry nights.</p>

<p>"I who speak mind me of the glory of sound even now,
and I ever loved the waters and the mere, and the voices
that whispered around me. Therefore went I a-fishing
on the mere, and the glories of nature were yet more
glorious than the Te Deums in choro. Therefore loved I
the rain on our hundred roofs, and the myriad voices that
came from the waterspouts.</p>

<p>"I didde sleepe on the south side, hard by the great
gabell, and soe heard I the sound whilst others slept.
Vai mihi, that it is departed! and the voices are heard
no more."</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">SITTING L. 30th July, 1911.</p>

<p>Although neither of us was aware of the fact,
this sitting was destined to be the last of the
series. Except for a few occasions in 1912, it
proved impossible to continue these experiments.
But Sitting XLIX. ends with a message of farewell,
and so, it will be seen, does the last of the
series. And in some respects the substance of
the writing is a sort of review of the part played
by Johannes, and offers an explanation of the
related influences which is full of interesting
suggestion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Simple he was, but as a dog loveth his master, so
loved he his Howse with a greater love than any of them
that planned and builded it. They were of the earth&mdash;planners
and builders for their great glory, nor ever,
though honest men, for the glory of God. But Johannes,
mystified and bewildered by its beauty, gave it his heart,
as one gives his heart to a beloved mistress; and so, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
earthbound by that love, his spirit clings in dreams to the
vanished vision which his spirit-eyes even still see.</p>

<p>"Even as of old he wandered by the mere and saw the
sunset shining on her far-off towers, and now in dreams
the earth-love part of him strives to picture the vanished
glories, and led by the masonry of love, he knows that ye
also love what he has loved, and so he strives to give you
glimpses of his dreams.</p>

<p>"Simple child of Nature&mdash;loving her, he knew not why;
but loving her yet more deeply because he knew not why
he loved. He was not meant to be a priest of the choire,
and it harassed him sometimes overmuch. Child of
Nature! He loved freedom, and was happier in the orchard,
and by the mere, than performing the rituals of the choir.</p>

<p>"Men loved him for his love, but ofttimes his Prior comprehended
not, and mistaking the outward show in which
he failed, for lack of that inner worship which they could
not feel, they made him do penances for which their backs
were more fitted. Then ye should know who would
understand him aright, and read his inner meaning.</p>

<p>"He would tell you what he saw, but how can he
describe it? It was beautiful, and his soul rejoiced as
he would have you also rejoice, but he could not tell you
why. It was good. It was pleasing to the eye, and
through the eye his soul was uplifted, in an age when souls
were grovelling.</p>

<p>"It was lovely, and he knew it, but when ye ask,
'What was it like unto?' he cannot tell you. It was
heavenly&mdash;so was the sunset&mdash;and the shadows on the
mere&mdash;but he could not paint these nor reproduce them
for you.</p>

<p>"Those others, the great add simple, are passed and
gone to other fields, and they remember not save when
the love of Johannes compels their mind to some memory
before forgotten.</p>

<p>"Then through his soul do they dimly speak, and
Johannes, who understands not, is the link that binds
you to them.</p>

<p>"Learn and understand.</p>

<p class="center">SITTING LI. (First of new series.) 26th January,
1912.</p>

<p>No previous questions asked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"HÆREWITH the Dane hath learned the greater
wisdom. Many gods there be, but though many names,
the principles are but two&mdash;Good and Evil, Love and Hate.
Therefore, when he slew the Saxons, he knew not that he
followed Evil, but repenting long since, he hath embraced
Love, which is Good, and his task is easy. Therefore is
he of the brotherhood, working with a glad heart to
expiate for ever the evil he once did, and therefore in
constant labour there in the joy of Heaven.</p>

<p>"'Purgatorio' would some of the brethren say, but the
Purgatorio is Paradise, if the intent be perfect and the
suffering has no half-heartedness. For awhile there is
joy in sins, but only till the day cometh. Run the race
with a whole heart, not as the lukewarm ones. Happiness
is in the extremes, but the only joy which lasts for ever
and grows for ever is the joy of striving for the Good.</p>

<p>"Thus was it of the beneficial influence of Glastonbury."</p>

<p>"Hærewith the Dane hath spoken&mdash;once warrior, now
striving ever for the good. Be not faint-hearted; strive

<p>In answer to a question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This have I told ye. I slept beneath the roof where

ordained that we should doe.</p>

<p>"Soe I remember those stayres for my fatness. But it
availed me not, tho' my father Prior recommended it oft.
Alas! I waxed more fat.</p>

<p>"Not that my belly was my god. I wot not! But I
was cheery and troubled not, save for services in ecclesia,
for better loved I the lanes and the woods where walked
I much&mdash;with weariness because of my weight.</p>

<p>"So said I, 'It is the Lord's will. Somme be made fat,
and somme be lean'; and this I said to they that jibed,
that the gates of Heaven are made full wide for all sorts,
so that none created should stick within the portall.
This I said, for they vexed me with their quips.</p>

<p>"I would remind me of many things. Half do I remember&mdash;yet
the lytell things only. The greate ones
(stick) even as I myself stuck in the portal by reason of
their trick, and Johannes, as once before, cannot rayse
themme and lies beneath their weight. I wold explain
but must gaine strength....</p>

<p>"I was ever soe: of a merry heart, when like to melte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>

of thought, save the thoughts I could not speak; and the
light jests comme again to me. Glad soule! Had I but
turned my soul to the things that were greate, I should not
be now a child among the toys. But I was never meant
to be a monk. They placed me here in choro, when I
would have drawn the sword...."</p></blockquote>


<p>EXTRACT FROM SCRIPT OBTAINED 15TH SEPTEMBER,
1912.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But one waiteth, even Johannes, whose body, scattered
to the winds of Heaven, once lay in the cemetery of the
monks, hard by the east side of the Chapel of St. Michael
in the midst of the graveyard. What matter? He lives
yet in the universal Memory, and speaks and acts through
every channel in which the Universal Life flows.</p>

<p>"Yet when he is himself, he speaks well, as he was wont
in the rude times that are as yesterday."</p></blockquote>

<p>In these brief yet pregnant passages the author's
philosophy is brought to a focus. Humbling the
arrogance of the individual mind, because it
denies that the mere mechanism of the human
brain can ever <em>originate</em> idea, it yet raises the little
limited self to the consciousness of a possibility,
awful and beautiful, of a contact with something
greater than itself, and yet akin; and to the dignity
of a mystical fellowship in which isolation ends,
and Past and Present are seen as parts of a living
whole; points in the circumference of a circle
whose radius is Life beyond these limitations.
Our little mechanism we may attune to respond
to the needs, the pleasures, and the interests of
our own fragmentary span; or, disdaining these,
we may harmonise it to the thought which is
pictured on the great outward sweep of the circle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of Memory, recorded there by the lives of those
of far distant times. Then will these records live
again for us and through the gates of our soul
will pour, from the living source of Idea, their
ordered recollections. Not by our own power, but
through the unseen Gate of the subconscious mind,
will these memories link themselves with ours&mdash;not
through the evocation of the "spirit" of Johannes,
but by the power of the Universal Spirit, whose
life permeates all the regions of Time, and in Whom
we and Johannes, and all who are in mental kinship
with his thought, are as one.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Gargoyle.</span></p>

<p>In mid-June, 1908, whilst the work of excavation
was still in its preliminary stage, J.A. and F.B.B.
were both at Glastonbury. At the western end
of the little town, at a fork in the road, stands the
lesser of the two surviving mediæval churches,
that which is locally known as St. Benedict's, but
which is in reality dedicated to Benignus, a companion
of St. Patrick when he came to Glastonbury
in the fifth century. This church was erected on
the site of a much older chapel, by Abbot Richard
Bere, whose arms and initials appear over the north
porch. It has a fine western tower of the regular
Somerset type, and on the cornice of the belfry
are several carved gargoyles, the most prominent
position, in the centre of the west side, being occupied
by a piece of carving which, when seen from
the west, as one approaches the town, has the appearance
of a well-executed head of an Abbot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
with a tall jewelled mitre and lappets. The face
is bold, and full of character, rather long, with
level brows and austere expression.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/fig_09.jpg">
<img src="images/fig_09s.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_9"></a>Fig. 9.</span></div>
</div>

<p>From the narrowness of the road, on nearer
approach, a side view of the carving can only be
obtained by turning the head up at a somewhat
uncomfortable angle; and probably for this
reason the extraordinary fact had apparently
quite escaped attention that this was in reality
no human head at all, but a peculiar grotesque
animal, with extended neck, crouching against the
wall in a manner peculiar to gargoyles, and with
a high arched back like a fighting cat, garnished
with knobbly vertebræ. It was J.A. who first
noticed this, and called F.B.B.'s attention to it.
Both were naturally much interested, though, of
course, it was the excavation work at the Abbey
which was the chief object of attention at the time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
and this was quite a side-issue. Shortly afterwards
a sitting was held, and the following is the
record:</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XXXII. 16th June, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q. by F.B.B.</i> "<i>With reference to the sculptured boss on
Saint Benedict's tower, which from different points of view
appears as an Abbot's head and as a grotesque animal:
was this intended for a joke?</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Wee know not the quips of they who worked
for us and did sometimes bee rude to them in powers.
We builded Benedicts. Wee know not what they wrought
soe only the church was faire and sound for ye people.
The greate workmen and ye masons of repute played noe
such pranks in our Abbey church, we wot.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">SITTING XXXIII. 17th June, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I, Johannes Lory, Master mason of ye Guild of St.
Andrew, carving of ye gargoyle of St. Benedick, came
downe from my laddere and walked, for it was colde and in
Octobere. Then turning backe I saw my worke was like
unto our Abbot, and soe I carved anew and made it proper.
Of a truth it was our Abbot, and soe sayd they who looked.
It was not my intent, but soe it was, and methinks our

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Script obtained at Oxford. F.B.B. And
J.A.</span> (Present, B. Blackwell and Miss D.
Sayers.) 25th August, 1917.</p>

<p>No previous questions. After a short passage
in Latin, which cannot be deciphered:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wolsey the Cardinal housing me with the King, and
did appoint me Abbot, olde man that I was.</p>

<p>"Here was the Hall that he builded in this town in
Chancellorium.</p>

<p>"I have said I came to Oxford, and Wolsey the Cardinal
did make me Lord Abbot in ye Hall that he had builded.
I was old and infirm, and came not on my palfrey, but
they carried me on my litter, and soe I, the old man, did
become Abbot in mine old age. Would God I had not
been so; then had my death been otherwise.</p>

<p>"Know ye the Hall which he ybuilded? It was where
ye now lie.</p>

<p>"I came not on ye palfrey. At ye Abbey of Westminster
I lay a long tyme, for I was sick. And with ye
Cardinal came I to Oxford, and he made me Abbot, I not
willing. I sleeped at Westminster. There saw I the King
and would know why he desired me for a friend, I being
Treasurer of mine Abbey. And soe yt was to be."</p></blockquote>

<p>The day before this sitting (Friday, 24th August)
I was in the Bodleian during the morning, and
looked at Dugdale's <cite>Monasticon</cite>, from which I
made the following extract: "On Beere's death,
47 monks devolved the election of their Abbot to
Cardinal Wolsey, who declared Richard Whiting,
then Chancellor of the House, their Abbot." I
had not shown this to J.A., nor had there been any
reference to Whiting in our conversation. The
reference to this episode in the script obtained on
the following day would therefore seem to involve
an element of pure mental telepathy, of an entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
subconscious nature since the matter was not in
my thoughts at the time of the sitting.&mdash;F.B.B.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XV<span class="smcap">A</span>. 1st February, 1908</p>

<p>This record has not been included in the general
series, as the subject-matter proved to be quite
foreign to anything hitherto appearing, or having
reference to Glastonbury. It is given as a specimen
of the "intrusions" which from time to
time broke the continuity of the main subject of
the writings.</p>

<p>First, a spiral coil was drawn, followed by some
letters or characters not possible to decipher.
Next a lozenge or rectangle; then a larger oblong
surmounted by a semicircle, as if to indicate a
domed building, a ramped line running at an
angle therefrom; and finally, a cross. Then the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"IBERICUS, who wandered hither bringing strange
gifts and treasure. Watch ye, for out of the wish it is
created, and out of the myth will come the solid truth.
Mystery of Faith and of Matter! Out of a thought all
things were created, and out of a thought will old-time
things renew their being.</p>

<p class="right">
"ONE OF THE CONTROLLERS &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
OF THINGS THAT ARE.<br />
A THOUGHT IN BEING." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Next followed more vague pencillings, and
several lines of quite undecipherable script, the
only two words legible being <span class="smcap">Constantinus</span> and
<span class="smcap">Justinian</span>. The writing clears up towards the
end of the page, and proceeds thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... who followed the Phoenician keels to far-off
Isles of the Sea whose treasure was great; whom Phaedrus
took in his ship to seek for safety and merchandise in one.
Phaedrus gained much tin, and left him on these shores, a
Prince among them, marrying Yseuguilt their Princess,
and they the forebears of a royal line. (Of) the countries
of the Iberi and Kymri they sat upon the thrones, and gave
the world the Name that lives in all the nations.</p>

<p>"Who am I? One that sojourned with them from
Capernaum through the Isles of Greece and past the straits
which Pharos lighted to stormy seas and black rocks where
the metals be.</p>

<p>"North, the settlement Tintagella; south, the river
mouths, and inland to the forest-lands and the marshes
where the rising of the sun. There builded he a Temple
such as was of old in Judah, and there he reigned. Thus
was I, O man! my name Phocis the Mariner."</p></blockquote>

<p>In tracing on a map of Cornwall the course
indicated in the script, east from the coast between
Tintagel and Padstow, my finger lighted
on a village on the fringe of Bodmin moor, marked
"Temple." Neither I nor J.A. were conscious of
the existence of this place-name, nor could we recall
our attention having been at any time directed
to it.</p>

<p>As to the identity of the royal traveller, the
script does not yield a definite statement. If the
name is there, it is to be feared that it is irrecoverable
owing to the hopelessly obscure nature of the
writing in the undeciphered portion. He came
from Capernaum, and he came&mdash;or was it
Phædrus?&mdash;seeking for safety and merchandise
in one. Can we identify his Princess? Yseuguilt,
or Yseult, is one perhaps of many, but it
may be that some record is yet extant of a Cornish
Yseult who married an Eastern prince or merchant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
And what have the antiquaries to say of Temple?
Whence did this little place derive its interesting
name? Was it merely from a house of the
fraternity of the Templars, or from some far older
and now half-mythical tradition, lost in the
mists of antiquity?</p>

<p>In a script dated 24 April, 1918, the following
passage occurs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The flow of spiritual forces is westward, following and impelling
the forces of material things. By a law of revolution reinforced from
all points in the spiritual universe, this movement is universal. This
being so, the material things first appear, working on a motive very
often in itself most mundane and from your point of view most unspiritual.
Thus they whose habitation was in Crete, revisiting the memories and
traditions of others of the same race and civilisation which long before
had been impelled westward beyond the great continents of America to the
shores of Asia, and thence onwards through the desolate tracts of Asia
to the great Mediterranean basin, still continued the interminable route
ever westward beyond the gates of Hercules to the islands where the fire-drawn
metals be: so, as mundane influences impelled them, great immigration
was induced by the want of metals for the embellishment of
temples, the hardening of bronze for warlike purposes and, in short, for
the many needs of man's development in civilisation and knowledge.
But soon the spiritual forces which developed and sustained this immigration
had deeper objects in view. They followed and transformed it
by removing mundane influences, and a great spiritual development
arose in the places in which their instruments had prepared the soil,
Phocis of the race of Crete trading with Poseidon and seeking Tyrian
purple, was thus brought in contact with them who worshipped the
One God in contradistinction to the many.... This paved the way
for the building of a Temple in his settlement of Tintagella....
Thus first arose that measurement and design which were afterwards
as accurately reproduced by that further advance which culminated
in the temple of Glastonbury....</p>

<p>"And Tintagella was the ancient place of the shrine of the High God.
So the Temple, a reproduction, accurate in every measurement was
reproduced at Glaston on this foundation....</p>

<p>"Phocis was Phocis&mdash;a centre and nucleus, a focus rightly named but
in himself but a merchant prince of Poseidon and Eubeia."<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>THE STORY OF EAWULF</h3>

<p><em>Note</em>.&mdash;During excavation alongside the south
aisle footing of the nave, in continuation of the
work on the south-west tower footings, an interment
of a curious nature was encountered.
The skeleton lay in the clay just outside the wall,
and the head was protected by a "dropstone"
having a cylindrical hollow, open at the neck, in
which lay the skull. Between the legs of the
skeleton was a second skull, but broken. At the
foot was a flat stone laid across, and against it on
the further side a number of leg-bones, etc. The
following was written shortly after the discovery:</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XXXIV. 19th September, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Radulphus Cancellarius, who slew Eawulf in fair
fight, did nevertheless suffer by his foeman's seaxe, which
broke his bones asunder.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> He, dying after many years,
desired that they who loved him should bury him without
the church where he was wont to feed the birds in his
chair. The sunne did shine there, as he loved it, for his
blood was cold." "It is strange, yet wee know it is true.
The head of Eawulf was (there). As they digged around
his body they knew not that the head of Eawulf fell, and
so lay betwixt his feet. And thus have ye found it.</p>

<p>"I, Gulielmus, I knew the old church that Radulphus
did pull downe, and much lieth beneath the floor of ye
newe church. Search estward of where ye now digge and
ye shall find much, and of the old work made they the
vaults, and some are deeper. Be not deceived by appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>ances.
Under where ye now think is the end of all, there
will be seen very deep walls of the older church. None
knew of them, and they were not destroyed. Seek also
north of the said cutting: there is somewhat there ye
might not know of."</p>

<p><i>Q. "Why was the head of Radulphus protected by a
dropstone, when the body was not enclosed?"</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Soe he wished it. Let the worms of the earth
devour my poor body with all its sinnes, saith he. Mine
head did ever fight against the body. It is the best part
of me. See ye, saith he, that ye protect it! That foul
body&mdash;let hym go, saith hee."</p>

<p><i>Q. "How did Eawulf come to be buried there, and who
was he?"</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Know ye not Eawulf, the Yarl of Edgarley, of
royal blood, who harried the Norman, and would have
slain Turstinus?<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> A doughty Saxon he, and one who said
that Glaston was builded by the Saxon, and Saxon it should
remain. So he was buried in Glaston, and not in his own
chapel at Edgarley.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> The holy men of Glaston, they who
were of Saxon blood, suffered much through his violence
in their behalf, and, God wot, through no rebellion of their
own; and they had their reward, for a Saxon<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> again was
Abbot for a time."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>
<p class="center">SITTING XXXVII. 23rd September, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q. "How is the great difference in date between Radulphus
and Eawulf to be explained? We cannot reconcile this."</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Wee know not your dates, nor the tymes gone by;
but this we know&mdash;Eawulf and Radulphus<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> did fight, and
the Norman did slay the Saxon. This is fact, as we know
it. Be sure of your own tymes and look at Domesday for
light.</p>

<p>"We remember (Radulphus) was an hundred years and
three when he went to hys fathers:&mdash;hale and of a good
visage even then&mdash;but hys bones did grieve him (by reason
of) ye payne in them. Soe did he seek ye sunne. More
we will serche in the great army of past things. They are
soe hard to find!</p>

<p>"That wych is hidden will be found out and all ye
Abbaye is at your hands; but serche. Alle three churches
are open to ye, and one whych was of old time in the midst
of the nave of ye newe&mdash;not much, for Turstinus did
remove ... them when he builded anewe the Norman
churche" (<i>i.e.</i>, built the new Norman church.&mdash;F.B.B.).</p>

<p><i>Q. "Did Eawulf lead the assault in the fight? How
did it come about?"</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Old men have strong anger, but youth should
have spared him. More we know not,&mdash;we wil serche."</p></blockquote>

<p>The script here breaks off into the description
(already given) of the pilgrims' procession at sunset,
with the music of organs and bells.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XLII. 18th April, 1911.</p>

<p>The problem of the dates was left for further
consideration, and remained in abeyance for two
and a half years. At this sitting other matters
of early history had been touched upon, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
occurred to F.B.B. to ask a question as to Radulphus
and Eawulf.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q. "Please explain the apparent discrepancy of dates in
the story of Radulphus and his fight with Eawulf."</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Ne Radulphus of Henry the King" (<i>i.e.</i>, FitzStephen,
1184.&mdash;F.B.B.). "Radulphus the Treasurer was
Norman of the time of Turstinus&mdash;annos One Thousand and
Eighty-seven. Ralph was hee. Eorwulf of Edgarley,
old in years, was wroth because the soldiers of Turstinus
did slay the Saxon monks. Ralph the Norman knight and
Treasurer of Turstinus, slew him. Who was hee?
Radulphus FitzHamon&mdash;as wee wot, an evil man."</p>

<p><i>Q. "Where was Ralph FitzStephen&mdash;of Henry II.&mdash;buried?"</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Ralph, ye cousin of ye King, dyed as we deem, at
Wincastre&mdash;there yburied. Chancellor of Angleland was
he."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The two foregoing answers were now
read, but unfortunately the first was incorrectly
interpreted, as the writing was a little difficult.
F.B.B. made the mistake of thinking that it implied
that Ralph of Turstinus was FitzStephen
(though the sense is clear enough on further inspection),
and consequently asked as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q. "Why do you say that Ralph, treasurer of Turstinus,
was Ralph of King Henry?"</i></p></blockquote>

<p>(Here the influence changes and a masterful
"personality" of whom we have had previous
experience, controls the utterance.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A.</i> "Rede. I said it not. I said not 'Ralph of the
King Henricus,' but 'Ralph ye Norman.' Taedet damnosum.
Lege!&mdash;IMPERATOR.</p>

<p>"Audi me, barbari stultissimi! Ego Imperator, qui feci
interpretationes pro anima insularium.&mdash;CAESAR."<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>PART III<br />

THE LORETTO CHAPEL</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The interest of this section is greatly enhanced by the fact that
the foundations of the Loretto Chapel were discovered last
summer in the place indicated by the script. The work of
excavation will not be completed until next season, but already
more than half of the plan of the chapel has been laid bare, and
a full report with illustrations has been contributed by the
author to the Somerset Archæological Society, and will appear
in their Proceedings for 1919, now being published early in 1920.
The report will be accessible to all archæological students at
the principal libraries. The footings of the chapel show that it
was 20 feet wide, as the script indicates, but the author's
interpretation was at fault in assuming this width to be an
internal one, whereas it is the external dimension. The length
may be found to follow suit. The chapel lies about 5 feet
within the bank as stated, and the west wall-footing is the best
preserved, thus bearing out the accuracy of the writings.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="THE_LORETTO_CHAPEL" id="THE_LORETTO_CHAPEL">THE LORETTO CHAPEL</a></h3>


<p>Among the lost features of Glastonbury Abbey
recorded by Leland<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> is a chapel built by Abbot
Bere on the north side of the nave. Leland says
of this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bere cumming from his Embassadrie out of Italie<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
made a Chapelle of our Lady de Loretta, joining to the
north side of the body of the Church."</p></blockquote>

<p>But apart from his record, which has preserved
the bare memory of the work and its approximate
location, we have no surviving facts, either historical
or descriptive, to guide us in the search
for its vestiges, save one or two trifles which the
orthodox archæologist would probably despise,
but on which the imagination might build an airy
and tenuous fabric, a mere gossamer which the rude
touch of practical argument would dispel, and
which would find its place more fittingly in the
pages of romance than in the chronicles of the
labours of serious-minded antiquaries.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a chance for the subliminal
mind to exercise its powers, just the opportunity
most desirable for an experiment in the psychology
of inductive and deductive processes, and a test<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of the possibility of drawing by the thread of
slenderest and most imperfect knowledge, some
kindred knowledge from the great reservoir of the
memory of nature. This experiment was made,
and the result of it I am going to give my readers
without any sort of reticence or reserve, making
no claim, but asking that they will regard it with
an open mind, and accepting it for analysis as an
illustration of the working of the latent powers
of the mind under the same conditions that we in
the onset laid down for our work.</p>

<p>The material from which our sublimated
essence was distilled was as follows:</p>

<p>1. Leland's note, as above.</p>

<p>2. A fragment of walling shown in Coney's
view of the Abbey, 1817. This appears in the
sketch just on the spot where the wall of the north
aisle of the nave would have joined that of the
transept at its eastern extremity, but it is diminutive
in height&mdash;only about a third of the height
proper to the nave wall, as is clearly evident by
comparison with the surrounding features. It is
like a little screen-wall, and such as might have
filled at one time an archway at this point opening
from the last or most eastward division of the
north aisle wall towards a chapel just without,
in the angle between the aisle and the north transept.
But in Coney's sketch it does not look like
a Gothic work, but is more like a building of the
modern times, since it has four little dumpy
windows with round heads and the projecting
cills which we associate with our everyday ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>perience
of domestic building. No one but Coney,
so far as I am aware, has indicated any sort of
remnant of building at this point, and there are
several older views of the Abbey, which would be
expected to show it if anything had been there.
Look, for example, at Stukeley's panoramic view of
the ruins, published in 1723. (See Fig. <a href="#Fig_10">10</a>, p. 115.)
Nothing visible there&mdash;the whole of the north side
of the nave an open field, as it had been for at
least half a century previous (<cite>vide</cite> Hollar's view).</p>

<p>3. In the Cannon MS., a diary referring to
Glastonbury about the time of George II., is a
sketch plan of the Abbey, very crude, in which
the writer shows a mound of rubbish and rough
stones with suggestions of a broken wall on the
ground at or near this point, and he makes a note
to the effect that it is the remains of "The Chapter
House."</p>

<p>But, of course, the Chapter House was on the
south side of the Choir, and could not have been
elsewhere in the case of Glastonbury, as its site
was never in doubt, and it has now been recovered
and its dimensions tested and proved.</p>

<p>4. Marsh, the old gardener at the Abbey for
over forty years, used to say to me that in the
grass bank which runs along the north side of the
nave area, under the trees, there was a fine bit of
freestone walling, some of which Mr. Austin, his
earlier employer, used up for building. I dug in,
but could find nothing of this at the point he
indicated.</p>

<p>Now, at the risk of being a little tedious, I pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>pose
to quote a short paragraph from my <cite>Architectural
Handbook</cite>, because it shows what I was
thinking about this matter in 1910, and such evidence
is needed for any useful analysis of the
psychology of the whole subsequent matter.</p>

<p>I would add that, so far as I can remember, my
friend J.A. had formed no theory as to the nature
of the chapel or its real position other than my
own, and what I here quote represents the utmost
that could at the time be said (<cite>Architectural Handbook
of Glastonbury Abbey</cite>, second edition, pp. 32,
33, 1910):</p>

<p>"Some fragments of building on the north side
of the nave were surviving as recently as 1817,
when Coney's drawings were published. In one
of these we see a wall with a row of windows having
a rather unusual detail in their heads (Fig. 10).
This would be near the site of the Loretto Chapel,
built by Abbot Bere. Carter, writing some few
years later, tells us that the Loretto Chapel was
then standing, and if he be correct, it must have
been a substantial piece of masonry exterior to the
church, and not a light internal structure within it,
as has been conjectured. But he may have been
referring to the Chapel of Saint Thomas the Martyr
in the north transept, which has sometimes been
miscalled the 'Loretto Chapel.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>"A sketch plan in the Cannon MS. shows a group
of ruins in an apparently similar position, and he
records the tradition of a very magnificent building
at this point, which he terms the 'Chapter
House.' However erroneous this designation, we
may at least accept his record as corroborative of
the existence of a richly ornamented building of
some special nature (as distinct from the body of
the Church at the junction of the Nave aisle and
North Transept)."</p>

<p>It seems, then, that we had formed the impression
of a fine building just outside the nave wall
and in the angle of aisle and transept; but to be
strictly accurate, I do not think that Coney's
sketch had much weight as regards the character
of the work it might have contained, and so far
as one's normal impressions were concerned, it was
dismissed as "modern."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Record of Excavation in 1911.</span></p>

<p>In the early part of June, 1911, the footing
trench of the north aisle wall of the nave was
opened up at its eastward end, and the junction
of the same with the west wall of the north transept
was found. The area just outside the angle
of the two walls was cleared with the object of
discovering traces of a chapel at this point, but
beyond a few very beautiful sections of window
mullions of the style of the late fifteenth or early
sixteenth century&mdash;good Tudor work&mdash;nothing
material came to light in the way of detail. But
about 13 feet west of the transept wall, and running
parallel to it, meeting the line of the aisle wall at
right angles and going north from it, was found
another broad foundation, and this we assumed
at the time to be the footing of the west wall of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the Loretto Chapel. The inference was clear that
there must at least have been some building of a
permanent nature, and rather substantial, attached
to the west face of the transept wall just
outside its junction with the aisle, and perhaps it
was not unreasonable at the time to suppose that
this was the Loretto Chapel. The architectural
detail discovered pointed to a Gothic chapel, and
was entirely inconsistent with such a building as
Coney showed. Neither was it of like character
with the work in the Nave. Such was the position
when, on 13th June, 1911, we obtained the
following automatic script:</p>


<p class="center">SITTING XLVII. 13th June, 1911.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I made that building. All that I didde anywhere is
fannes. Ne barrel vault. And under them, three faire
windowes of foure lights with transomes and littel castel-work
on the ramps thereof. And if ye digge in the wall
of the navis, there is much fell in. Serche the great pier
of the nave opposite the cutte: yt is full ... but they
threw therein the fragments of my capella, a canopy at the
west, and all the central ones&mdash;faire canopy work, and in
the midst a littel one for Our Ladye, sylver guilt and very
faire. Somewhat remaineth of ye outer walls and ye
walle by ye crossinge, but they have taken hym mostly
away long syne. Very deepe fannes ... and each fanne
had twelve ribs, and they were ycoloured red and gold,
like my chapel of Edgar. There yet remaineth somewhat
of Our Ladye. Yt lieth in front of the west walle three
feet or thereabouts. Seek ye well out the bank to the
Est: something remaineth of ye transept (?) wall whereon
we placed the tabernacles, but most is ygone. Ye doore
unto hym is at the west,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> nigh unto the pillar of the navis,
one doore only, on nave.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"R. B. scripsit, pro instructionem tuam. Ye roundels
of ye volte were golden, and also ye bosses, and ye hollows
were bright redde; likewise ye tabernacle of Oure Ladye
in the est wall golde and redde; and ye windowes were of
glasse yellow in canopies with redde and blewe in ye little
lights thereof. Ye floore was of tileis red, with shields, and
ornaments in yellow likewise, and it was very faire and
magnifical, like unto my chappel of Edgar, but more faire,
for I builded hym later, for I hadde a vowe of mine owne
which I performed."</p>

<p><i>Q. "What was your vow?"</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Know ye not that wee were borne downe by rude
men in foreign parts and the mule which bore me fell,
for I was a grete and heavy man. And being like to fall
down a steepe place or be trampled by ye mule, I called
on Oure Lady and shee heard me, soe that my cloke catching
on a thorne I was prevented, and then said I: 'Lo!
When I returne I will build a chapel to Our Lady of the
Loretto, and soe instant was I inn (my vowe) that the
brethren were grieved, for yt was arranged in Chapitre
that wee shold build a Chapel to oure Edgare before I

it was a public vowe: but mine owne vowe I fulfilled
afterer, and soe all was well&mdash;Yt is given."</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Know ye not of my Ambassadrie, when ye Kinge

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Notes on Beere's Embassy.</span></p>

<p>Abbot Richard Bere was deputed by Henry
VII. to visit Rome in 1503, in order, it is said,
to congratulate the new Pope, Pius III., on his
election. Whether there was any political object
intended to be served by his embassy does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
appear, but it is strongly suggested by subsequent
events. The new Pope did not live to establish
his policy. He survived his election only twenty-six
days, and was succeeded during the same year
by Julius II., a "political" Pope, who formed
the "League of Cambrai," which was followed by
the "Holy League" of powers against Louis XII.
of France, including England, Spain, and Venice
in the bond, which Henry VIII. afterwards joined,
until the peace with France in 1514 ended it.
As to the story of the journey, the mention of
Padua as his port of call seemed odd, and a little
hard to understand. The usual route to Rome
for English travellers of that period was via
Antwerp, Augsbourg, and Venice. From Venice
he might have taken boat to the wharves of
Padua, and would thence proceed southward
along the Adriatic side, till near Ancona, and here
he would strike Loreto, which would be the start
of an overland journey, the Apennines being
crossed possibly on mule-back.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q. "What were the dimensions of the work about which
you have been telling us?"</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Yn feete twenty and two, and foure paces in
width thereof, and ye walle of ye nave was strengthened
thereby, for ye towre hadde pressed ye walls through
the volt of the navis, and hee was crackt all ye way to the
bottom thereof. Therefore my chapel was high, in height
twenty and three feet, and very strong in the volt, soe
that it tied the wall of ye nave and ye wall of ye crossing
where it was weake. They who builded ye towre should
have made arches in ye walle to help ye higher windowes,
carrying them along ye crossing in ye walle to helpe ye
towre at ye angle, but they did not. Therefore helped
I yt by my chappell and by an arche I builded from ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
toppe of ye aisle to the roofe of ye chappell to bond ye
whole at ye angle. Also builded I ye grete arches in ye
towre. It wasne ye volte that did caste out, but ye towre
gave inne as against ye volte by reason of its weight,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
and soe it even gave away from<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> the crossing in its lowre
part and gave out in its upper.&mdash;R. B."</p>

<p><i>Q. "Can you give us an idea of the state of opinion in the
religious establishments of your day&mdash;of the views and ideals
current?"</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Ne helde I wyth superstitions. Ever I was for
ye people and ye better understanding of ye mysteries.
It was meet that it be soe, and notte kept in the hearts of
the religious only. More wold ye? What more I didde
as seemed best, for the old tymes were changing and
menne loved the glory of our ceremonial. They were
angered at the deceits which hadde kept their fathers
humble and meek. Through the eye the glory of our
services might make them wish for noble things, but I
knew, and hee my friend knew<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> they were no longer
to be fooled with trickery. All was changing in my day
and the wars made for greater knowledge. The Englyshe
were (a)sleepe no more, ne ever to be. Dixi."</p></blockquote>

<p>The dimensions given for this little chapel could
be applied to the foundations discovered only if
the longer measure (22 feet) were taken north and
south, and the shorter (four paces) east and west.
This would make the building cover one bay of the
transept, and extend to the outer footing wall
exposed by the excavation. But this footing did
not stop at 22 feet, but ran on north, and was found
to be co-extensive with the northerly projection
of the transept, so that the chapel described
would only have occupied one-half of the length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and it looked as if there had been an aisle to the
transept such as F.B.B. showed in his drawing of
the reconstructed interior. The description of the
strongly built little chapel in the angle, buttressing
up the weak tower and transept wall, was a plausible
one, but the description, and especially the
dimensions, would not throw any light on Coney's
sketch, and left the wall in the bank, spoken of by
the gardener, still unexplained. The dimensions
were small&mdash;unsatisfying for a special work of
this nature, and one which had merited individual
mention by Leland. And the proportion was so
unusual, in that the east and west measurement
was the lesser and would be insufficient for its
purpose, one would think, unless the altar were
placed at the north end, which would not be an
English custom. Was this little building, after
all, the real Chapel of the Loretto, or was it only
an antechamber, through which access would be
had from the nave to a more important work
farther out? The long aisle-like footing looked
like an adit or approach. It could hardly have
been part of the transept because of the sharp
difference in level between the two floors, that of
the transept being 4 feet or so above the nave.
But only further digging could bring light, and
this was at the time impossible, so there the matter
was bound to remain until a more favourable
opportunity should occur for further research.
So it rested for five years.</p>

<p>In December, 1916, F.B.B. and J.A. found
themselves near neighbours, and it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
mutually agreed, in view of the greatly revived interest
in the subject of spiritual phenomena, that
the experiments in writing should be resumed, but
no definite day had been fixed. Some days before
F.B.B. had given J.A. some MS. notes to
transcribe, being extracts he had made some years
before from the Cannon MS. It had been proposed
to publish these in the <cite>Proceedings of the
Somerset Archæological Society</cite>, and with them was
the sketch of the ruins already referred to, at
which both had casually glanced; but this had
not been the subject of attention. and J.A.'s
transcript had not arrived at that point when
the first sitting was held. This was on 4th
December. Glastonbury matters were not to the
fore in recent conversation, which had been given
to the subject of the Greek Cabala and the geometry
connected with it. J.A. says his mind was
still full of this on 4th December, to the exclusion
of Glastonbury, and that the reference in the
Cannon MS. had not been in his thoughts.
F.B.B.'s experience was similar. He had been
busy with letters until the moment of J.A.'s
arrival, and his last envelope having been sealed,
he, on the spur of the moment, proposed a sitting,
to which J.A. agreed. F.B.B. had an idea that
if any writing were obtained it might be on the
subject of the war and current events; and J.A.
anticipated something on geometrical symbolism.
No suggestion was made as to the subject of the
proposed communication. The following is the
record:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>


<p class="center">SITTING. 4th December, 1916.</p>

<p>The first page of writing is cramped and well-nigh
illegible. The following can be made out:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cosmic facts are everywhere, but not easily attained....</p>

<p>"... by assembling yourselves together and obtaining
the inspiration ye seek consciously or unconsciously. The
result obtained is the same, but the word endures....</p>

<p>"... The material world is the screen between&mdash;the
complex fabric of the simple weaving. The essential facts
are eternal which (? move) in a circle, and to them that
know the circle, somewhat will pass into all times, only
ye see but little at a time. The centre is the point on
which all revolves, and ye, revolving, are conscious of the
influence, but cannot know the radius...."</p>

<p>"Obliviscor. So long we have slept near Capella
Loretta under the bank full thirty paces from the Navis.
Ye did not go farre enow beyond the (bank) they cast up
there. It was full five feet in, and buried in the place
where he didd drawe the Chapitre Howse.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> and the end
of the pilgrimmes (way) is ... through ye porche, thro
ye wicket gate in ye corner, and by ye steppes over against
ye lower graveyard. There shewed wee the relics and ye
pilgrimmes passed by this way to the Chapell of St. Mary,
by ye steppes, and to Navis majoure."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then in a different hand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Abbot Bere ybuilded ye Loretto Chapel faire and large
to the north (side of the) navis. We said that itt ... was
not ye Chapitre Howse....</p>

<p>"... The syde of it was distant from ye navis thirty-one
feet and a half, and from ye aisle of ye transept he
was fulle tenn feet with a covered way unto, and four
steppes up unto ye aisle aforesaid. Yt ... was ybuilded
by Bere most faire and wonderfull in ye newe style brought
from Ytaly when he didd goe there upon ambassadrie.</p>

<p>"Ye have heard of yt. Ye Chapell was full forty feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
and width between twenty and ... twenty-one feet, and
hee had an entrance unto (hym) from the roade which
ledde from St. John his gait unto ye navis, and thus
might ye B<sup>p</sup> and the Kinges majestic (enter).</p>

<p>"Bere used to approach by entering into the Claustre,
and soe he didde close it oftentimes."</p></blockquote>

<p>The foregoing script at first sight seemed impossible
to decipher, and a repetition was asked
for. This was clearly written, and by its aid the
sense of the foregoing was mastered, and word by
word picked out, but there are yet some seemingly
hopeless blanks. These, however, may not be
material, and will probably refer to the ruinous
state of the Chapter House and its repair, as
re-stated in the following communication:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have said he was of the Ytalian style new and very
faire, and Bere ybuilded coming from embassadrie in
Ytaly. Hee was not ye Chapitre, but Bere did use hym
so because ye Chaptre House was dammp and ruinous
and was being repaired. We have said so. Hee met ye
King and ye B<sup>p</sup> who sojourned (with him). The same
was forty feet (long) by twenty (or) thereabouts and his
grylled doore was to the west and a pavement joyned him
to the Road from St. John's gate to ye churche.</p>

<p>"He wasne like anything else (but was of the) newe
style. There were four steppes&mdash;nay, six&mdash;to the aisle
of ye transeppt, and a covered way vaulted in a rounde
vaulte to ye Chappell....&mdash;THESIGER."</p>

<p>Q. "By 'steps' do you mean ascending steps, or paces?"</p>

<p>A. "Ten feet, and four or six steppes up to hym."</p></blockquote>

<p>The signature "THESIGER" is of peculiar
interest. At the beginning of this communication
will be seen the words "Obliviscor."
"So long we have slept near Capella Loretta,"
etc. Only once before, at Sitting XLII., on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
7th September, 1910, has the same signature
been observed. This was at the close of a communication
dealing with the shrine of St. Dunstan,
and was given as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sub marmore dormio, quod taedet me&mdash;obliviscor.&mdash;CAMILLUS
THESIGER."</p></blockquote>

<p>The identity of this person was at the time a
matter of speculation, but F.B.B. concluded that
it must be meant for Camel, the Purse-bearer to
Abbot Bere, whose marble tomb with coffered
panels is a feature in St. John's Church. Camel had
a house in the upper part of the town, in the High
Street, on the south side, some little way above
St. John's Gate, and to the east.</p>

<p>The architectural details which we here reproduce
were then given, some explanatory notes
appended.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Review.</span></h3>

<p>It was with a sense of astonishment that, after so
great a lapse of time, this interesting communication,
so voluminous in detail, and, so apparently
explanatory of doubts and difficulties in connection
with the obscure problem of the Loretto Chapel,
should have presented itself unsought, unexpected,
and inclusive of strange new elements
which suggested the existence at Glastonbury in
Bere's day of an architectural model which would
be unique for the period in these islands, and
probably without parallel in Northern Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>Several questions arise in the mind. Could
the little windows in Coney's sketch have stimulated
a subconscious dream of an Italian chapel?
But where are we to look for the original model
of these undulating parapets, Lions sejeant with
shields, patellæ, fruit and flower enrichment, the
conchoidal "Cava Virginis," and the precision of
the general proportions? Was there, in the subconscious
memory of either of the sitters, some
forgotten impression of a building in Padua or
elsewhere in Northern Italy, which in its main
features, or subsidiary detail, might tally with
what was here given? That we cannot say, for
nothing of the sort could or can be recalled by
the conscious mind.</p>

<p>Should the day come when the bank of rubble
on the north side of the nave of Glastonbury
Abbey can be thoroughly explored, it may be that
beyond some traces of the freestone wall spoken
of by the old gardener there may be found <em>nothing</em>>;
but if, on the other hand, it should appear that by
the same obscure mental process which has already,
in the case of the Edgar Chapel, predicated
the existence, with practical truth in form and
detail, of a building whose very memory was lost
(and the evidence for which had been ignored, nay
even scouted, by the most competent antiquaries),
another architectural treasure, long buried and
forgotten, might once again be brought to light,
and its wealth of Italian detail verified; then,
indeed, would come into sight new vistas, new
possibilities of exploration and research into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
secrets of old time, and we should stand at the
threshold of the Gate of Remembrance.</p>


<p class="center">SITTING. 16th August, 1917 (at Gloucester).</p>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;The objects sought in this communication
were formulated by F.B.B. in advance.
They chiefly concerned the discrepancies between
the two descriptions of Bere's buildings given at
previous sittings, 13th June, 1911, and 4th
December, 1916, the first of which referred to
some work unidentified. F.B.B. suggested that
the discovery of the footings of the transept
"aisle" immediately before the former of these
two sittings had created a mental bias in favour
of a "chapel" there, and thus confused the script.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Maestro ... Francesco de Padua qui me instruxit
et capella(m) cognoscit in Italia. Ille etiam scripsit cum
me et ille ... (struebat) in modo Italiano, et mecum in
nave navigavit ad Brit(tanniam). Ille aedificavit et ornavit."</p>

<p>"Deepe, by ye Bank, is ye walle where ye fathers didde
sit in their old age; and they had not the use<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> of the
younger brethren, but were free&mdash;and who wished to
spend hys dayes in ease and luxury? But capella wasne
in muro in Boreali parte. I have told ye. It was soe,
and in the banke deepe down ye shall find hym full perfect
as I do think. There was a deepe place where they destroyed
and they covered him and made a banke full six feet high,
and soe saved the wall at the west end for all tyme.</p>

<p>"Ask ye, what was the chapel under the Tower beyond
the Porche? He was for the reliquaries, and ye did enter
hym from the garth on the syde of St. Mary's and uppe
four steppes to him, and soe through to the upper garth
and ye road to the John's Gate."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>"Wysdom&mdash;it was best soe. The Land was ycovered
with the houses of God, and the grass he could not grow,
and it was in the providence of God that the houses were
destroyed, for they held no life. Men desired fuller life
in ye world, and to travel far; and the old faith<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> was no
longer needed, for the minds of men were no longer as ye
beasts that perish, but each man was a light unto himself
and did need no father to control him&mdash;so it was best,
though much loveliness was destroyed in the undoing.
The Spirit liveth still, and what we lived for, in new guise
we give to you. Grow in the Spirit. We are a symbol of
great truths, and ye read the symbol aright. That which
we did dream lives on, and in the Spirit we pass it on to
you, from symbol to symbol&mdash;ever higher, ever wider.</p>

<p>"As great books were we, and our work was in stone&mdash;a
language handed down for you to read, which we had
forgotten, and so fell.</p>

<p>"What wold ye?"</p></blockquote>

<p>At this point there was a pause in the writing.
Neither F.B.B. nor J.A. were aware of anything
that had been written. The sheets were replaced
and laid aside as they were filled, and nothing
was suggested during the writing by either sitter.
There was a little conversation on other subjects.
At this point it occurred to F.B.B. (though in
ignorance of the question "What wold ye?")
to ask the following, and he wrote it down on
the paper.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q.</i> "<i>Do you confirm all that was told us of the Italian
design of the chapel of the Loretto? Please say what building
in Italy was the model chosen by Abbot Richard Bere
for this work.</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Francesco de Padua aedificavit. Two would
speak of it&mdash;he who made it and I who moved for my
fannes and English. We both made hym&mdash;I, and he, my
friend."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Capella di Marco<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> at Padua&mdash;hym by the Key.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>"Dominic di Vallera Castiglione<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> aedificavit anno 1497&mdash;via

<p>At this point the sitting was broken off and
resumed on the evening following&mdash;17th August,
1917.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q. by F.B.B.</i> "<i>Please tell us plainly, what was the building
22 feet long and 4 paces wide spoken of on 13th June,
1911? What was its use and what was its dedication?
This is the building with the fan-vaulting. Tell us exactly
where it stood.</i>"</p>

in vestibulo sub turre&mdash;English volts&mdash;and Capella Lorettae
(in) Ytaliano modo.</p>

<p>"Capella Loretta was on ye lower level, with four or six
steppys up to the pavement. One steppe to hym from the
way from John's Gate to the North Porche.</p>

<p>"Seek my chapple as I told ye in ye Banck. He was
entered from ye West, and had a door into the littel

<p>"That which the brethren of old handed down to us,
we followed, ever building on their plann. As we have

latter days.</p>

<p>"All ye measures were marked plaine on ye slabbes in

recorded, as they who builded and they who came after
knew aforehand where they should build. But these
things are overpast and of no value now. The spirit was
lost and with the loss of the spirit the body decayed and
was of no further use to (us).</p>

<p>"There was the Body of Christ, and round him would
have been the Four Ways. Two were ybuilded and no
more. In ye floor of ye Mary Chappel was ye Zodiac, that
all might see and understand the mystery. In ye midst
of ye Chapel he was laid; and the Cross of Hym who was
our Example and Exemplar.</p>

<p>"Braineton, he didde much, for he was Geomancer to
ye Abbey of old tyme."</p></blockquote>

<p>These curious statements appear to have a
bearing on certain facts recorded of the Lady
Chapel and upon others which have come to light
as a result of the study of the whole plan of the
Abbey Church and Monastic buildings. The latter
were found to be laid out on a series of commensurate
squares of 37 × 2 (or 74) feet, and it has
been observed that there is no divergence from the
symmetry of these squares in the works of the
successive centuries right up to the time of the
last Abbot, for the Edgar Chapel falls into line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
with the rest. Thus the outer measure of the total
length of the Great Church with St. Mary's Chapel
is 592 feet, or eight commensurate and consecutive
squares of 74 feet each, and the width of the Nave
and Quire are each one such square. The plan
has been already most useful in locating the position
of walls destroyed and lost. There is much
yet to be done in order to complete the plan, but
it is, in the main, recovered, and has been published
in the <cite>Proceedings of the Somerset Archæological
Society</cite>, from which it is here reproduced (Fig. 12).</p>

<p>As to the engraved geometric lines on the floor
of St. Mary's Chapel, it may be well to quote
William of Malmesbury, whose record of this
dates from the twelfth century. This old chronicler
says, speaking of this chapel, which was on
the site of the oldest Christian church:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This church, then, is certainly the oldest I
know in England, and from this circumstance
derives its name (<i>vetusta ecclesia</i>).... In the
pavement may be seen on every side stones
designedly inlaid in triangles and squares, and
figured with lead, under which, if I believe some
sacred enigma to be contained, I do no injustice
to religion."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>The plan of the Chapel is itself a perfect instance
of the Vesica Piscis, the proportions of the
double equilateral triangle and the most sacred
and cherished mystery of the Christian temple
builders (see <cite>Proceedings of the Somerset Archæological
Society</cite>, vol. lxii., 1916, pp. xxxviii-xl).
For the "Four Ways" see such early instances of
the Rood as the example at Lucca Cathedral,
where the arms of the Cross are held in a circle,
suggestive of the zodiac, and point to the position
of the four fixed signs Aquarius, Leo, Taurus, and
Aquila or Scorpio, corresponding to SS. Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John, figured in the Christian
symbology by the Angel, the Lion, the Bull, and
the Eagle respectively. What is implied in the
foregoing communication, when it is stated that
of the four ways, they only builded two, is not
known to the writer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>F.B.B., not being yet quite satisfied on the subject
of the script of 13th June, 1911, repeated a
part of his former question, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Q.</i> "<i>But where was that building 22 feet long and 4 paces
wide, with three four-light windows and fans. I cannot see
how the measure of 22 feet is obtained. Was this an east-and-west
measure, or to be taken north-and-south?</i>"</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Ye door into ye transept in ye north, which I,
Camel, used; he was in ye west porche and under the
three high windowes.</p>

<p>"What wold ye? The newe Chappell, he was in ye
Bank far oute, in line with ye Transept as I remember yt.
He wasne finished or ever. Chappells a many! Everywhere!
Why cumbered they the ground when faith was
dead, and there was no longer any need for hym? The
purse<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> was full, it must be spent, and so, when nor
barn nor byre nor pent called for it, it was yspent. Why
should roysterers and evil men have it to spend? So we
builded much.</p>

<p>"Chapels everywhere&mdash;ne need of them.</p>

<p>"Small chance it is preserved (<i>passage doubtful</i>), but it
was well ycovered, I wot, for them who would pull downe.</p></blockquote>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p class="hang">The plan lies in a hexagon. Its measures are based upon the
standard British foot of 12 inches. The breadth between the
faces of the central buttresses is 37 feet, in harmony with the
general scheme of measures found in the Abbey. The length
of the vesica is approximately 64 feet, and its points touch
the outer faces of the end walls. External to this is another
vesica embracing the plinth-course (see plan). The interior
shows a third, marking three-quarters of its length. Each
vesica contains a rhombus of two equilateral triangles. Their
measures are symbolic and explanatory of the sacred geometry
of which the "Gematria" of the Greek scriptures is illustrative.
Thus, the solid rectangular area of this building is 37 by
64, or 2,368 square feet, by Gematria the equivalent of ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ
(Jesus Christ) or Ὁ ἉΓΙΟΣ ΤΩΝ ἉΓΙΩΝ (The Holy
One of Holy Ones). The rhombus contained has the area
1,184 square feet, very possibly designed to record the date
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1184) of the erection of the Chapel. It will be noted
that William of Malmesbury alludes to the "sacred enigma"
believed to be concealed in the triangular and other figures
on the floor of the Chapel.</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement is now sufficiently explicit.
It is possible to form a plan (see Figs. <a href="#Fig_15">15</a> and
<a href="#Fig_16">16</a>). The little cloister alongside the wall of the
transept forms a western aisle to the same, covering
one bay, whose width is known to have been
22 feet nearly. At this point it merges into a lobby
or vestibule, at or near the foot of a fair-sized
turret which stands at the north-west angle of
the transept. This lobby has doors on all sides&mdash;(1)
south, from the cloister communicating with
the nave; (2) north, to the upper garth, and the
path used by Camel the Purser, who lived in High
Street; (3) east, and up the steps through the transept
wall, into the transept itself; and (4) west,
into the short corridor of 10 feet leading to the
Loretto Chapel.</p>

<p>A final question was asked, and the result is
interesting, as the question was a mental one,
asked by F.B.B., not written nor communicated to
J.A. by any ostensible means. F.B.B. formulated
the question in his mind thus: "What was the
surname of the Paduan architect Francesco?"
Answer: "<i>Vecchi.</i>&mdash;<i>Francesco di Vecchi.</i>"<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>This not being quite as clear as was wished, the
question was repeated, and the reply came as
follows: "<span class="smcap">Vecchi</span> <i>di Torcello in Italia</i>."</p>

<h3><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></h3>


<p>So ends the "Loretto Chapel" script, with a
series of precise and categorical statements, offering
no means of escape from the final alternative
of truth or falsehood, fact or fiction. This situation
will be clear to the reader, as it is to the writer
of this narrative, who, for the reasons now about
to be given, entertains no misgivings as to the
course he has taken in publishing it.</p>

<p>His motto here would be, "Prove all things,
and hold fast that which is good." These writings,
whose value is at present unproven, and in respect
of the detailed statement of names, dates, and
places, highly problematical, are put forward as
an illustration of the working of his method.</p>

<p>They are not to be accepted with credulity,
but are subjects for critical analysis, and must be
weighed and examined, with all the rest, in the
light of reason, assisted by every useful means of
normal research and exploration.</p>

<p>If we are resolved to accept nothing which is not
first fully endorsed by reason and common sense,
and afterwards fortified by deductions fairly made
from data, however slender, we stand but little
risk of being deceived. Let us, therefore, apply
to this case the same rule which the writer has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
already successfully applied in the case of the
Edgar Chapel.</p>

<p>Intuition has played her part. From the depths
of the subconscious mind her power has evoked
these images. Now let Reason and Logic take
the reins and drive the argument. Let us analyse
the facts, such as they are, which bear upon the
case, and in the light of the intuitive results see
whether an argument may be built up which will
be capable of supporting weight.</p>

<p>In this lies the true utility of the method we
have chosen. It claims a double value&mdash;(1) in
its ability to remember and to review subconsciously
an infinitude of minor things, slightly or
casually impressed upon the mind and unnoticed
or unremembered by the working brain; and (2)
the faculty of balancing, assessing, and combining
these in such manner as the brain itself is rarely
if ever able to do, and hence to evolve from slenderest
data a scheme in which all probabilities
which can lawfully be inferred from these minutiæ
are welded into a complete whole.</p>

<p>For a moment, let us go farther and assume
that some of the statements made in the script
are not merely incapable of proof, but are found
actually inconsistent with facts. Where then do
we stand with our theory?</p>

<p>As I have said, until the statements are accepted,
no one is deceived unless by his own rashness.
All that has happened is that two people having a
perfectly honest purpose have attempted to record
by automatic process knowledge arrived at by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
trained exercise of the subconscious mind, and
have obtained&mdash;let us say&mdash;fiction or romance
instead of the fact they sought.</p>

<p>The logical inference from this failure will
obviously be that the particular method employed,
whilst it may have the value claimed for it
of supplementing the ordinary reasoning powers,
has proved unreliable where applied for the
purpose of procuring statements whose truth
does not (as in the case of the Edgar Chapel)
depend upon the deductive or inductive probabilities,
but upon isolated facts unrelated to others,
such as the names of places and people unknown;
and that therefore, as a general conclusion, the
method is unsuited for the purpose of obtaining
such information, and we have used it for an end
for which it is not adapted.</p>

<p>Thus may the legitimate bounds of the automatic
method be prescribed; Intuition must
bring all her results to the bar of Reason for provisional
acceptance, and when this test is passed
then the matter becomes ripe for further research.</p>

<p>Above all, let us not be superstitious. There
is no need to invoke the action of supernatural
agencies of a malevolent sort to explain the outcome
of our own fallibility. If a man or woman
sits down and produces automatically a story
which turns out to be fiction, why, I ask, should
that fiction be regarded as anything inherently
worse in origin than the mass of fiction, good, bad,
and indifferent, which writers produce consciously?</p>

<p>Where is the essential difference? The only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
answer I can find to this question is that the
difference lies in the folly of the credulous, who
are at all times willing to attach greater importance
and credit to a statement made from an unknown
source than to one which has a definite
human and personal origin. "Omne ignotum
pro magnifico."</p>

<p>For the imaginative function, whether working
consciously or unconsciously, is the same in either
case. Give it truth to feed upon and it will
evolve truth. And through the door of truth
may enter that which will guide us to a wider
knowledge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<td class="tdj"><i>The Deep Place.</i>&mdash;The mention of a
"deep place" calls attention for the
first time to a number of facts which
group themselves in a manner suggestive
of such a probability. They are
as follows:<br />

(<i>a</i>) Stukeley's view (1723) (see
Fig. <a href="#Fig_9">9</a>) seems to indicate a drop on
the north side of the nave and transept,
to a lower level.<br />

Coney's view (see Plate <a href="#PLATE_IV">IV</a>.) certainly
shows the small building on the
north side of the nave with a break
in the ground just in front of it, marking
a lower level for the wall.<br />

(<i>b</i>) The configuration of the ground
is in favour of this. Above and eastward
of the Abbey enclosure is a
narrow valley running west, and filled
up in its lower part, over which lies the
northern section of the Abbey enclosure.
The High Street runs down
the north side of this valley, and parallel
to it, and closely adjoining the
Abbey wall is Silver Street, a name
said by some antiquaries to indicate a
ford.<br />

(<i>c</i>) The drainage of the Abbey
church is down the north side, as would
appear by the direction of the drainage
channel in the foundations of the
Edgar Chapel, and the larger water-channel
whose course was traced
diagonally beneath the floor of the
quire.<br />

(<i>d</i>) In excavating the north porch,
a very deep pit was found right against
the north-west angle of the footings.
It went down nearly 10 feet below the
floor-level of the church. This may
have extended east and west, and the
north porch may in that case be supposed
to have been approached by a
paved way over a bridge.<br />

<i>The Bank.</i>&mdash;The foot of the bank, as
nearly as may be estimated, lies about
27 feet north of the position of the
nave wall (outer face). This would
bring the 31 and a half feet distance indicated
by the script for the wall of the
chapel, about 4 and a half feet within the
bank, and this would seem to accord
with the old gardener's recollection.<br />

The bank runs westwards as far as
the north porch, or about 108 feet west
of the transept, so that the west end of
the chapel as described would be well
covered, being some 40 feet east of the
termination of the bank.<br />

The extreme projection of the transept,
beyond the line of the inner face
of the nave wall, would be about 60
feet, and not less than 54.<br />

The thirty-one and a half feet
measure from the outside of the nave
wall, if added to the probable thickness
of the latter, will give a total of
39 or 40 feet, and if this measure is assumed
to be to the inner face of the
chapel wall (south) the position of its
outer face would accord with the 37 feet
general line, following the symmetric
scheme on which the whole abbey is
found to be built (see Fig. <a href="#Fig_12">12</a>), and the
north side of the chapel will then come
very nearly into line with the transept.</td>

<td class="tdj"><i>That the ground on the north
side of the Church sloped down
formerly to the bed of the brook
coming from the hill behind the
town. This would make a depression
about 10 feet deep alongside
the Church, at a distance,
roughly, of about 40 feet north
of the outer face of the nave aisle
wall, and immediately north of
the projection of the north transept
and porch. The bed would
have been partly filled when the
Abbey was standing, and there
would be a system of drains beneath
the soil, which would have
been levelled to form a garth or
garden a few feet below the nave
floor, terminated on the west by a</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span><i>
path or pavement from the porch
to St. John's Gate (running due
north), and beyond this, again to
the west, would be another garth
at a still lower level, to the north
of St. Mary's Chapel and the
Galilee, following the general
trend of the grounds, which slope
to the westward. This part was
the cemetery of the laity.</i><br />

<i>It is inferred that Bere's Chapel
of the Loretto may have stood on
the upper garth, its floor a few
feet below the nave, and at about
the distance mentioned in the
script.</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<i>That the present aspect of the
ground, which shows a uniform
rise to the north of the Abbey, is
thus totally misleading, and the
bank and the higher level beyond
on the town side must be altogether
artificial, and nothing but</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span><i>
a huge accumulation of débris from
the destruction of the Abbey. The
bulk of the ancient work now
destroyed was so enormous that
there is no difficulty at all in supposing
this, notwithstanding the
fact that a great quantity of the
masonry went, as is known, to
make a foundation for the new
road to Wells.</i><br />

<i>The further inference is made
that under this bank will most
likely be hidden a great deal of
fragmentary work, and that its
removal will bring to light many
things of archæological interest.</i><br />

<i>That the Loretto Chapel, if its
position be correctly given in the
script as 31 feet 6 inches from
nave, would appear nearly in line
with the transept (north end),
when viewed from the north, but,
if anything, rather further out</i>

<td class="tdj">(<i>a</i>) The wall-footing discovered in
1911 shows a possible breadth of 12 feet
or so for this aisle. The thickness of
the footing is evidence of a strong construction.
There were some marks of
a cross-foundation at a point over
20 feet out north, and near the face of
the bank.<br />

(<i>b</i>) The indications were in favour
of a lower level for this work. The
drop from the transept level to that of
the nave is about 4 feet, and this aisle
or passage would appear to be on the
nave level.<br />

(<i>c</i>) Benedictine houses did not usually
have western aisles to the transepts,
as is the case with cathedral
churches. But Glastonbury followed
Wells in some things, and at Wells
there are western aisles to the transepts,
and that on the north side has
screens on two sides, within arches to
nave and to transept.<br />

(<i>d</i>) The detail found on this site was
of very fine late perpendicular window-tracery,
showing the existence of
windows with heavy central mullions,
and most likely of four lights.<br />

(<i>e</i>) Camel's house was in the High
Street at a point which would be
readily approached by a path towards
this part of the Abbey Church.</td>

<td class="tdj"><i>That the foundation discovered
in 1911 is not that of a chapel, nor
yet of an aisle to the transept,
properly so called, although it
might be thus described since it
would have that appearance from
without.</i><br />

<i>The inference is that this adjunct
would have been on the nave
level, and its use connected with
the nave. It would have been
primarily a passage-way from the
nave to a court or to buildings on
the north side, and it would be
properly described as a cloister
alley.</i><br />

<i>In this position it would, if
substantially built, most readily
serve the useful purpose of contributing
support to the central
tower and to the walls near the
crossing, adding stability to the
transept if affected by the weakness
of the tower, and furnishing
support for flying buttresses to the
north-west angle of the crossing
and tower itself.</i><br />

<i>There would be little object in</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span><i>
carrying it out further north than
would be requisite to cover one
bay of the transept wall. This
would make it a possible 22 feet in
internal measure. There would
be normally a double square on
plan, and if fan-vaulted this
would give two bays, and two
windows to the west and one to the
north&mdash;three in all.</i></td>

<tr><td class="tdj">
December 4, 1916. "<b>Abbot
Bere ybuilded ye Loretto Chapel
faire and large, to the north (side
of the) Navis.... Yt was
ybuilded by Bere most faire and
wonderful in ye newe style
brought from Ytaly when he
didd go there....</b>"<br />

"<b>We have said, he was of the
Ytalian style, new and very
faire, and Bere ybuilded coming
from embassadrie in Ytaly....
He wasne like anything else, (but
was of the) newe style.</b>"<br />

<i>Here followed the detailed
sketches showing&mdash;</i><br />

1. <b>A rectangular chapel of
four bays, with a small apse to
the east, as a "Cava Virginis."</b><br />

2. <b>Parapets of undulating outline,
and others suggestive of the
fleur-de-lys, with indications of
fruit and flower enrichment.</b><br />

3. <b>Sitting lions, bearing
shields, over each division of the
bays, mounted on small pillars
with "patellae" or plaques,
dividing the parapets.</b><br />

4. <b>Heads of angels or cherubs,
probably in the cornices.</b><br />

5. <b>Round-headed windows,
and vaults with bands of carved
fruit and flowers on the groin-ribs.</b></td>

<td class="tdj">(<i>a</i>) The Chapel was built just after
Bere's embassage to Italy. He was a
cultivated and learned man with a
knowledge of architecture, as is evident
from the quality of his building works.
He must have been supported by capable,
if not eminent, master-builders
and craftsmen.<br />

(<i>b</i>) Bere was impregnated with the
new ideas, and was the friend of Erasmus.
A letter of his to Erasmus is extant.
His sympathy with new and
more liberal views would be reflected in
a wider culture, and the influence of the
Italian Renaissance, already affecting
English art in minor ways, may well
have moved him to become a pioneer in
introducing the style which, a half-century
later, usurped the place of our
native "Tudor" forms. These he used
as a master, and had developed them
to their highest pitch.<br />

(<i>c</i>) The duration of his visit to Italy
is at present unknown to us, but the
circumstance of the death of Pius III.&mdash;if
he overstayed that event&mdash;would
make for delay and give him time to
devote to the study of Italian architectural
models.<br />

(<i>d</i>) The circumstances of his vow are
also, so far as we know, not a matter of
history; but the vow itself or the intention
which clearly implies it is our
reading of Leland's note.</td>

<td class="tdj"><i>That a Chapel dedicated to
an "Italian" Madonna, erected
by an Abbot of liberal views,</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span><i>
impressed by the newer learning and
culture, immediately on his return
from a visit to Italy, at a
time when the forms of Italian
Renaissance were in process of
adaptation to Gothic buildings,
might well have been influenced
in its design by Italian ideas,
even to a wholesale extent, and
that if an Italian master were employed,
as appears by no means
an unreasonable idea, an entirely
Italian model may have been
followed.</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdj">August 16, 1917. "<b>Maestro
Francesco de Padua qui me instruxit
et capellam cognoscit in
Italia ... struebat in modo
Italiano.</b><br />

"<b>Francesco de Padua aedificavit.
Two would speak of it&mdash;he
who made it, and I who moved
for my fannes and English. We
both made him.</b>"<br />

(<i>Name of the model for this
work</i>)&mdash;<br />

"<b>Capella di Marco at Padua&mdash;hym
by the Key.</b>"<br />

"<b>Domenic di Vallera Castiglione
aedificavit anno 1497&mdash;via
St Ursula.</b>"<br />

(<i>Name of Bere's architect</i>)&mdash;<br />

"<b>Vecchi&mdash;Francesco De
Vecchi.</b>"<br />

"<b>VECCHI di Torcello in Italia.</b>"</td>

<td class="tdj">The Chapel is undoubtedly a thank-offering.
It is built to the honour of
Our Lady in the particular aspect of an
"Italian" saint of local repute, possessed
of the attribute of protection to
life and health. The choice of a style
and character for the monument designed
by Bere would very naturally be
consonant with that prevailing locally&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
Italian.<br />

(<i>e</i>) A few fragments of plain moulded
work, of Italian character, have been
noted amongst the débris of the Abbey.
These were hitherto supposed to have
belonged to some Elizabethan building,
now destroyed, whose remains had
somehow found their way into the
general mass of Abbey fragments.</td>

<td class="tdj"><i>That the type that would evoke
most readily the Abbot's artistic
sympathies would be a North
Italian type, not too far removed
from the principles of architectural
form to which he had been habituated.
An entirely Roman model,
on purely classic lines, is for this
reason less likely. But the selection
of an Italian master for the
purpose of carrying out Bere's
scheme almost necessarily follows
if the intention to employ an
Italian style be conceded. Bere
could not do this unaided, as an
Abbot would not be his own architect.</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></td></tr>


<tr><th class="center" colspan="3">D.&mdash;<span class="smcap">As to the Style of the Building at the Angle of the Transept and North Aisle of Nave.</span></th></tr>

<tr><td class="tdj">Script, June 13, 1911. "<b>I
made that building. All that I
didde anywhere is fannes. Ne
barrel vault. And under them,
three faire windowes of foure
lights, with transomes and littel
castel-work on the ramps thereof ... and
each fanne had
twelve ribs, and they were
ycoloured red and gold, like my
chapel of Edgar....</b><br />

"<b>... Ye roundels of ye volte
were golden, and also ye bosses,
and ye hollows were bright redde,
likewise ye tabernacle of Oure
Ladye in the est wall golde and
redde; and ye windowes were of
glasse yellow in canopies with
redde and blewe in ye little lights
thereof. Ye floore was of tileis
red, with shields and ornaments
in yellow likewise."...</b></td>

<td class="tdj">(<i>a</i>) As an integral part of the Church
the probabilities lie in the direction of
the use of Bere's own master-masons
for this work, and the choice of the
customary English style seems to
follow. This would be all the more
consistent with probabilities if the work
were involved with the strengthening
of the older masonry at the crossing of
the Church&mdash;a work known to have
been necessary, since Leland records
the fact that Bere strengthened the
central tower by the addition of the
"St. Andrew's" arches beneath it (see
Plate <a href="#PLATE_III">III</a>).<br />

(<i>b</i>) The fragments of window-tracery
already referred to as having been
found on the site are English in character.</td>

<td class="tdj"><i>That the building in the angle
of the nave and transept was
formed with the double object of a
support to the weak walls of the
crossing, and as a covered approach
to the Chapel of the
Loretto, erected by Abbot Bere on
a site adjoining the north side of
the nave, but not attached directly
to same, and that this cloister was
built in the later English style in
which his own masons were
expert.</i></td></tr>

 See paper by James Parker, M.A., in 1880 volume of <cite>Som.
Arch. Proc.</cite>, p. 101, where he says, speaking of the Edgar Chapel:
"The question is, What did Leland mean by the 'est end of the
chirch'? Does he mean the choir? Of course, I cannot say
that he does not. But there are two considerations. The first
is the view preserved by Stukely, taken by his friend Mr. Strachey
before the Abbot's House was pulled down, and, as I understand
it, some few years before 1723. In this a larger portion of the
second chapel in the south transept remains than now, and it is
lettered 'Edgar Chapel.' He seems to have obtained his name
from hearsay, and possibly no importance ought to be attached
to the tradition by itself. The other consideration seems to me
more worthy of attention, and may perhaps support the tradition,
where it is said in the next paragraph which Leland gives in
reference to Abbot Bere, that he 'arched' on both sides, the
east part of the church."
</p>
<p>
Parker proceeds to argue that this arching probably refers to
the east end <em>of the nave</em>, not of the choir, and that if so, then
Edgar's Chapel belongs to the same work, and would thus be connected
with the transept also. "And there," says Parker, "it
is placed in the only engraving which gives the name." "On the
whole," he concludes, "I think it must be left an open question as
to what Abbot Bere built; at least, that the evidence is not sufficient
to justify putting Edgar's Chapel <em>at the east end of the choir</em>."</p></div>

 At a later date the excavations revealed a small chantry
adjoining the south side, as at Gloucester Cathedral (Lady Chapel).
This extends the width to 48 or 49 feet. If a similar chantry were
appended to the north side (again following Gloucester) the
extreme width might be close on 60 feet ("viginti virgas").
But of this nothing is known. Colonel Long's MS. plan, found in
1910, gives the 49 feet width.</p></div>

 The ancient "Book of Melchin" (now lost), quoted by John
of Glaston, says of Joseph of Arimathea: "Amongst them Joseph
of Marmore, named of Arimathea, receives perpetual sleep; and
he lies in <i>linea bifurcata</i> near the south corner of the Oratory which
is built of hurdles." "Linea," according to Ducange, means
"an under-garment," and "bifurcata" would denote one slit
at the sides like a shirt or dalmatic. But our script seems to
suggest rather "a fork in the paths" as the place where Joseph lay.</p></div>

 The wall of the vestry was subsequently dug for and found outside
the bay of the south quire wall third from the west, where
there were indications of such an appendage in the grooving of
the masonry for the flashings of a lead roof, and the plinth mould
had been shorn off to get rid of an inconvenient projection. The
trench showed a thin wall giving a vestry about 9 feet wide.</p></div>

 The great breadth of the footings of the rectangular part of
Edgar's Chapel&mdash;about 6 feet 6 inches on the north and south walls&mdash;might
easily have inspired a wrong opinion as to the substance
of the walls themselves. But students of the work of this date
are familiar with the fact that the flat and heavy fan-vaulted
stone roofs of the Tudor period require, in addition to their external
buttresses, a certain amount of interior support, which is
given by building the walls as a series of hollow bays, the windows
occupying the recesses, and the intermediate masses being
brought out inwards, as piers or counterforts, the same being
architecturally treated, so that the description elsewhere given of
"piers as panellæ" is quite probably accurate, as a description
of such features.&mdash;F.B.B.</p></div>

 The local gardeners and workmen had a story of a large

Thyer, now dead, told F.B.B. that he had assisted the late owner,
Mr. Austin sen., to fill up a part of this and to remove the flat
stone coverings which he needed for his building work.</p></div>

 The length of the mediæval "pace" was unknown to us,
and would have been inferred to be the natural length of a walking
"step" (in F.B.B.'s case 22 inches).
</p>
<p>
But to reduce paces to feet, or <i>vice versa</i>, is not easy by mental
arithmetic, and the calculation was not made. Hence this
CCCXI conveyed nothing definite.
</p>
<p>
But publication necessitated scrutiny of this statement, and,
to assess the true length, reference was made to William Wyrcestre's
<cite>Itinerary</cite>, wherein, speaking of Glastonbury Abbey
(p. 292), he says:
</p>
<p>
"Longitudo navis ecclesiae monasterii continet 54 virgas vel
100 gressus"&mdash;making 54 yards = 100 steps.
</p>
<p>
If 100 steps= 54 yards, one step = 1·62 feet. So we have our
material for calculation, as follows:
</p>

<p>
I. Length of church                         311 × 1·62 = 503·82 feet<br />
"et capella nova" (<i>i.e.</i>, and the new chapel) (add)      90·00  "<br />
<span style="margin-left: 28.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 28.5em;">593·82&nbsp; "</span><br />
&mdash;an amazing result! Elizabeth's commissioner, quoted on p. 12,
says:</p>
<p>"The great Church in the Aby was ... 594 feet." And our
own plan (Fig. 12), based on careful measurement, yields the total
592 feet! (The 580 feet measure discussed on p. 62 is an <em>internal</em>
measure.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">32</a>
 DCCXXXIII pedes <i>circa</i> (<i>about</i> 733 feet)&mdash;at first sight a
hopelessly discordant measure, being 140 feet in excess of the
first&mdash;yields on analysis an even more astonishing result. For
733 feet circa <em>is</em> 311 paces; but Romano-British paces&mdash;not
mediæval! 311 paces of 2 feet 4-1/4 inches is 733 feet. The true
Roman pace (single) is 2 feet 5 inches&mdash;occasionally less in Britain&mdash;so
we see it in this case slightly shortened. And the qualification
"circa" gives us the slight latitude which the computation
requires.</p>
<p>It is as though our question, addressed to the previous informant,
had been answered by another in a literal sense, according
to his own knowledge of the measure, and without reference to
the monkish standards. (See note in synopsis at end of vol.,
<i>sub.</i> "Ell" and "Passus.")</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

 <i>I.e.</i>, the Abbot's "rebus" (F.B.B.). A <em>rebus</em> is the enigmatic
equivalent of a name. Many of these are known to have
been adopted by Bishops and other ecclesiastics of note. In
the case of Bere, the significance is obvious. Where a name
ended in "ton," as Morton, Pereton, etc., a "tun," or barrel, has
been used to complete the rebus.</p></div>

 This seems written in defence of the feminine form "Phocis"

a man of Phocis. A correspondent had raised this point in a letter
to F.B.B., but J.A. was totally unaware of it.</p></div>

 Radulphus Cancellarius. This we supposed, at first, to refer
to the great Radulphus or Ralph (FitzStephen), who was responsible
for the rebuilding of the Abbey Church after the great
fire of 1184; but this would be eighty-three years after the time
of Turstin, first Norman Abbot (1082-1101). Malmesbury tells
us of the trouble that ensued from the tyrannical methods of
Turstin, and the slaughter of the monks by hired soldiers. But
the story of Eawulf is new.</p></div>

 Eawulf, Yarl of Edgarley. The name was quite unknown to
us. Edgarley is about a mile out of Glastonbury on the south-east.
There is an ancient chapelry there, dedicated to St.
Dunstan. Subsequent reference to the old English Chronicles
brought to light the following entry under date A.D. 885:
</p>
<p>
"Eanwulf, Earl of <em>Somerton</em>, buried in Glastonbury Abbey."
Somerton is about six miles from Glastonbury on the same side
as Edgarley&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, south. This is interesting, as suggesting a
family name perpetuated for some six generations, or about
200 years, in the district.</p></div>
